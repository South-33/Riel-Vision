# Riel Vision

Riel Vision is a lightweight computer-vision banknote counter for mixed Cambodian Riel (KHR) and US Dollar (USD) photos, designed for real-world retail environments.

## Performance Benchmarks
These metrics measure how the hybrid one-detector Riel Vision model (trained on **2,416 real** and **3,096 synthetic** images) compares to previous baselines on our test slices:

| Test Set Slices | Roboflow API | Base Model (Real Only) | Riel Vision (Real + Synth) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Easy / Clean** (separated bills) | 48.5% | 48.6% | **92.3%** |
| **Partially Blocked** (hand/finger occlusions) | 0.0% | 1.0% | **93.6%** |
| **Overlapping** (stacked/piled bills) | 1.6% | 6.0% | **56.6%** |

> [!WARNING]
> **Benchmark Bias Note**: These metrics are evaluated on static local test slices and reflect bias toward our specific validation conditions. Real-world performance under uncontrolled environments and arbitrary smartphone cameras will vary.

## Current Milestone & Honest Status

Riel Vision is currently a **research prototype**. We believe in being honest about what our model can and cannot do:

* **Our Approach**: We train the base model on real-world photos (which work well for clean, separated notes), and then use our custom WebGL synthesis engine to render the gaps—like overlapping banknotes and partially blocked banknotes—where real-world training data is scarce or difficult to label.
* **What Works Well**: Easy, clean, separated banknotes.
* **Active Challenges**: Dense, complex overlapping stacks, hand-held fan layouts, and extreme folds/crumples.

## Technology Stack

* **3D Synthesis Engine**: Powered by **Three.js** to generate exact-label training annotations (bounding boxes & segmentation masks) under controlled camera angles, lighting conditions, and note dirt/wear.
* **Edge Inference**: Running a lightweight **YOLOv8 detector** directly in the browser via **ONNX Runtime Web** (WASM-based). The model is only **9.8 MB** on disk with **2.42M parameters**.
