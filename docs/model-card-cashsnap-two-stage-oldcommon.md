# CashSnap Two-Stage Old/Common KHR Diagnostic Model Card

## Purpose

Small phone/browser-oriented diagnostic stack for partial and overlapped KHR banknote counting experiments. This is not a production CashSnap model.

## Artifacts

- Stack config: `configs/cashsnap_two_stage_oldcommon_browser_stack.json`
- Detector ONNX: `runs/cashsnap/yolo26n_legacy_clean_plus_realcutout_low_skin_ft_e6_i416_b8/weights/best.onnx`
- Fragment classifier ONNX: `runs/fragment_classifier/mobilenet_v3_old_common_khr_realbox_pretrained_balanced_e12/best.onnx`
- Browser demo: `demo/browser/`

## Classes

Detector classes follow the 13-class CashSnap v1 denomination list: USD 1/5/10/20/50/100 and KHR 500/1000/2000/5000/10000/20000/50000.

Fragment classifier classes are only `KHR_1000`, `KHR_5000`, `KHR_10000`, and `KHR_20000`.

## Fusion

Current diagnostic fusion, refreshed on 2026-05-27:

- Detector proposal confidence: `0.05`
- Fragment crop padding: `0.0`
- Detector override confidence: `0.17` (`0.175` ties on the current draft)
- Class-agnostic NMS IoU: `0.85` (`0.75-0.90` ties on the current draft)
- NMS ranking score: detector confidence

## Current Evidence

On draft labels for `real_overlap_0003_commons_shop_5k_10k_20k`, the focused old/common KHR classifier plus detector-threshold fusion reaches:

- `6/6` any-class visible-region matches
- `5/6` same-class matches
- `6` predictions for `6` draft visible notes

The deployable browser path should be checked with `scripts/smoke_browser_demo_cdp.cjs`, because Edge ONNX Runtime Web/canvas preprocessing is the deployment truth and can differ from PyTorch-generated proposal CSVs around borderline detector scores. Current Edge autorun smoke on the same shop-overlap image predicts `6` bills with `KHR 56,000`, `USD 0`, and classes `KHR_1000:1;KHR_10000:3;KHR_20000:1;KHR_5000:1`. Evaluating the browser-exported CSV against the draft labels gives `6/6` any-class matches but only `3/6` same-class matches.

Broad 14-class fragment classifiers and a 3-class KHR/USD/background gate did not transfer to this real shop-overlap probe; both remained too confused for browser/mobile deployment.

Raw detector-only thresholding is not enough. In the same refresh, the detector can reach full same-class recall only at `416/conf=0.03` with `23` predictions for `6` notes, while `416/conf=0.05` gives `5/6` same-class and `14` predictions. Existing Khmer OCR (`mer`) also failed as a shortcut on the same crops, returning scattered text and wrong/partial denomination digits, so OCR remains optional auxiliary evidence rather than the core path.

## Known Limits

- Tuned against one draft-labeled real image, so treat metrics as calibration evidence, not a benchmark result.
- Does not cover all KHR denominations, rare current notes, USD fragment re-reading, or reliable old/new issue disambiguation.
- Real fan, hand occlusion, off-frame, worn-note, and mixed KHR/USD performance is not solved.
- Production claims require a rights-clear reviewed phone-photo benchmark and non-benchmark reviewed training crops.

## Required Next Data

Track new captures in `manifests/real_partial_capture_inventory.csv` and run:

```powershell
lr python scripts/check_capture_requirements.py
```

The highest-value missing data is rights-clear phone photos with human-identifiable partial KHR slices, especially `KHR_20000` and `KHR_50000`, across simple overlap, hand fan, hand occlusion, and off-frame scenes.
