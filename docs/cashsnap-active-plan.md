# CashSnap Active Plan

Read this first when the repo feels noisy.

## North Star

Build a small phone/browser-deployable CashSnap model that counts mixed USD and Khmer Riel banknotes from real mobile photos. The model must keep clean-note accuracy while learning rare KHR classes, old/common circulated notes, and eventually partial, overlapped, fanned, and hand-occluded notes.

## Current Decision

The active path is now a 3D synthetic-pipeline reset before the next training push.

The strategic goal is to build a scalable 3D data factory that can generate trusted, phone-like, perfectly labeled banknote scenes from Numista scans. Do not start another model-training run until the renderer proof can produce plausible visual images, exact visible masks, scoreable labels, and QA artifacts.

Use Numista `in_circulation` raw folders as the clean KHR metadata backbone for issue/year/side scans. Non-Numista public data, including Roboflow and Wikimedia/Commons photos, is domain stress or review material until note design and circulation scope are checked. Do not let old, collector, or out-of-scope note designs silently define success.

Use 2.5D only as a comparison baseline or fallback. The 3D proof should explicitly test whether physically configurable scenes give CashSnap a real scaling unit. The synthetic work should use realistic camera/domain knobs:

- lens/aspect/crop variation
- color temperature and tint
- exposure, contrast, blur, grain, sharpening, and JPEG compression
- real or visually QA'd backgrounds
- class balancing for weak KHR classes, especially `KHR_20000` and `KHR_50000`
- clean separation between Numista/NBC current KHR, current rare KHR, old/common circulated KHR, and USD

The first Numista 2.5D calibration probes improved real-overlap region coverage but still overcounted and confused old/common KHR backs. Later reviewed-P1, broad Roboflow-partial, and targeted Numista `KHR_5000` face/number probes all preserved some crop metrics but did not beat the real shop-overlap diagnostic. Do not keep chasing tiny one-image gains with more generic partial mixing; invest in the renderer proof.

The immediate bottleneck is high-quality, rights-clear, scoreable real evidence:

- a benchmark/validation set whose labels are human-legible and quality-gated
- targeted `KHR_5000` portrait-plus-5000 overlap photos matching the row-6 miss
- reviewed `KHR_20000` thin/edge photos
- enough clean replay so full-note and current-scope validation do not regress

After reviewed fragments improve denomination identity without clean-validation regression, scale into:

- simple overlap
- shop-counter spreads
- partial off-frame notes
- thin visible slices
- hand-held fans and finger occlusion

## Parked But Not Deleted

The original WebGL/3D plan is parked behind a proof gate. Keep `docs/3d-scene-composition-pipeline.md` as a design reference, but do not treat it as the next implementation path unless a small Windows-stable ID-pass proof beats a matched 2.5D dataset on reviewed real labels.

Do not spend more broad effort on public dataset hunting unless a targeted lead appears. Recent sweeps did not find a better KHR partial/fan source than the existing Roboflow lead plus rights-clear phone captures.

OCR is optional auxiliary evidence only. Current Khmer OCR cues are too noisy to drive the detector path.

## Working Rules

- Use `ideas.md` as the short living board. Keep the top dashboard current.
- Use `docs/synthetic-harness-runbook.md` for 2.5D generation commands.
- Use `scripts/bench_train_with_headroom.py` or another headroom wrapper for long/heavy jobs.
- Never train on `data/real_fan_benchmark/`.
- Do not pass a mined background bank into training until its contact sheet has no visible banknote fragments.
- Treat ambiguous synthetic fragments as `banknote_unknown` or ignore, not forced denomination labels.
- Use `manifests/real_fan_benchmark_label_quality.csv` to decide which draft benchmark boxes are scoreable; do not punish models for ambiguous/non-human-identifiable fragments.

## Immediate Milestones

### M1: 3D Pipeline Spec And Asset Atlas

Keep `docs/3d-scene-composition-pipeline.md` current as the active renderer spec. Rebuild or audit scan/cutout assets from Numista `in_circulation` first, then NBC/current references if needed. Keep issue year, side, and circulation bucket explicit.

### M2: Renderer Smoke

Generate a tiny 3D smoke dataset with visual pass, ID pass, visible labels, masks, metadata, and contact sheets. No training yet.

### M3: 3D Vs 2.5D Transfer Proof

Generate a 100-300 scene proof dataset and a matched 2.5D dataset. Only then train a short fresh-base probe under the headroom harness and compare scoreable real labels, clean validation, and browser/export smoke.

### M4: Scoreable Real Fragment Loop

Collect or review non-benchmark real fragments that match scoreable failures. Prioritize `khr_5000_face_number_overlap`, `thin_slice_khr_5000`, and `thin_slice_khr_20000`. Build a trusted fragment-classifier refresh only from accepted rows, verify against quality-filtered draft labels plus clean/base validation, and keep clean replay in the mix so the model does not forget full-note recognition.

### M5: 3D Decision

If 2.5D transfer stalls for geometry-specific reasons, build the minimal WebGL/3D proof: one curled note, two overlapping notes, one fan, one occluder, visual pass, ID pass, visible boxes, OBB, masks, crops, and deterministic Windows reruns.
