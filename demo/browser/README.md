# CashSnap Browser Probe

Static ONNX Runtime Web demo for the current two-stage old/common KHR diagnostic stack.

Run from the repository root so the page can fetch the model artifact:

```powershell
lr python -m http.server 8787
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8787/demo/browser/
```

For repeatable smoke checks with the shop-overlap candidate:

```text
http://localhost:8787/demo/browser/?image=/data/real_fan_benchmark/images/candidates/real_overlap_0003_commons_shop_5k_10k_20k.png&autorun=1
```

Or run the headless Edge smoke from the repo root:

```powershell
lr python scripts/run_with_headroom.py --interval 2 --max-percent 90 --resume-percent 82 --max-ram-percent 90 --max-gpu-mem-percent 90 -- node scripts/smoke_browser_demo_cdp.cjs --screenshot .agent/cashsnap-browser-smoke-cdp.png --out-csv .agent/cashsnap-browser-smoke-cdp.csv
```

The demo reads `configs/cashsnap_two_stage_oldcommon_browser_stack.json`, then loads:

- Detector: `runs/cashsnap/yolo26n_legacy_clean_plus_realcutout_low_skin_ft_e6_i416_b8/weights/best.onnx`
- Fragment classifier: `runs/fragment_classifier/mobilenet_v3_old_common_khr_realbox_pretrained_balanced_e12/best.onnx`

It fuses low-confidence detector proposals with the KHR 1k/5k/10k/20k crop classifier and uses detector-confidence NMS. It is suitable for browser plumbing and review hints, not reliable denomination totals yet.

Smoke note: the autorun shop-overlap URL loads the ONNX stack in Edge and predicts 6 bills, but the denomination total is still wrong (`KHR 56,000`, `USD 0` vs the draft-label total of `KHR 70,000`, `USD 0`). Current browser classes are `KHR_1000:1`, `KHR_5000:1`, `KHR_10000:3`, and `KHR_20000:1`; evaluating `.agent/cashsnap-browser-smoke-cdp.csv` against the draft labels gives `6/6` any-class matches and `3/6` same-class matches. Sweeping detector override thresholds on the browser CSV only improves to `4/6` at `0.03-0.05` and introduces `USD_100`, so treat this as working browser plumbing, not solved counting.

The smoke JSON includes debug counters such as detector output dims, browser proposal count, classified count, and final count. Current debug output is `[1,300,6]`, `11` proposals, `11` classified crops, and `6` final detections.
