# CashSnap Model Brain

This is the living working memory for model and synthetic-data decisions. Keep it
short, current, and decision-oriented. Old detail belongs in `docs/archive/`,
registries, or the folder structure itself.

Major history snapshots:
- `docs/archive/model_brain_pre_housekeeping_2026-06-08.md`
- `docs/archive/model_brain_pre_cleanup_2026-06-07.md`
- `docs/archive/model_brain_pre_compact_2026-06-07.md`
- `docs/archive/model_brain_full_history_2026-06-06.md`

## Shape Rule

Keep this shape simple and stable:

1. Yardstick And Posture.
2. Research Frame.
3. Promotion Gates.
4. Validation, Labels, And Scope.
5. Repo Hygiene.

Do not split the live context into separate "current read", "current bet",
"next move", and "evidence" sections. Those are one thing. If the direction
changes, update `Research Frame` in one pass so future agents do not inherit
contradictory stale fragments.

Do not use this file as an artifact index. Folder placement, archive folders,
JSON registries, generated-list locations, and `rg` should answer "where is that
file?" This file should answer what we believe, what is blocked, what not to
repeat without a new reason, which ideas look promising, and what gates decide
promotion.

This file is context, not a command queue. A future agent should read it,
challenge it, inspect the current repo/results, and choose the best next step by
their own judgment.

## Yardstick And Posture

North star: build a small phone/browser-deployable model that counts mixed USD
and Khmer riel from one casual retail photo.

Current phase: synthetic data must transfer to real clean-visible notes before
the project seriously moves into overlap/fan/hand curricula.

Hard clean-base target: `0.82-0.85` full real test mAP50-95. This is realistic
because a near-size real-trained control has already reached `0.819153` on full
real test.

Current reality:
- Fast fixed-step filtered185 reference: `0.075907`.
- Slow synthetic-only filtered185 reference: `0.142098`.
- Current synthetic-only fixed-step leader, target-anchor latest-design
  transplant: `0.144740`.

Distance to target is roughly `+0.68` to `+0.71` mAP50-95. Small gains under
`0.25` are mechanism clues, not a trajectory toward done.

A useful candidate direction should answer at least one of these:
- Does it reduce real positive misses at usable confidence?
- Does it reduce giant/full-frame or empty-frame false positives?
- Does it protect weak/high-value classes instead of trading them away?
- Does it reduce real-vs-synth representation/domain separability for the right
  reason?
- Does it expose a missing real validation bridge, label policy, or harness
  limitation that must be fixed before scale?

Working posture:
- Be a good researcher, not a comfortable executor.
- Be bold but bounded. Prefer experiments that can fail loudly and teach the next
  direction over safe micro-tweaks that only make one proxy look tidier.
- Be willing to redo, restructure, or replace the harness when the harness blocks
  the right question.
- Research first when the path is fuzzy: read the code, docs, prior artifacts,
  papers, or web sources as needed. Preserve only conclusions that change a
  decision.
- Run a Builder/Skeptic pass before non-trivial direction changes: why could this
  create a regime change, and why might it be too small, misleading, already
  disproven, or proxy work?
- Ask the uncomfortable questions: What would make this fail? Has that already
  happened? Are we measuring what is easy instead of what matters? What simple
  obvious idea are we avoiding? What would collapse the most uncertainty?
- Do not chase pretty contact sheets, row-count comfort, or one-seed wins.
  Promotion is real/deploy utility under guardrails.

## Research Frame

The current working research frame is an obligation-driven sim-to-real rebuild
for clean-visible note transfer. Treat this as a hypothesis to challenge, not a
script to follow: start from real failure clusters when that still looks like a
good use of time, build candidate data that names which obligation it attacks,
and promote only when real/deploy guardrails improve.

Current read:
- Synthetic transfer is the bottleneck. Synthetic self-eval and package QA can
  pass while real transfer fails.
- Target-anchor latest worked because it combined train-only CashSnap no-note
  pixels, real CashSnap geometry, and latest-design target assets. It is a
  direction signal, not a trainable foundation.
- The current leader misses `669/817` real-test GT boxes at `conf=0.05` and fires
  on `174/748` empty test images. It is not close.
- Detector representation gaps show synthetic-vs-real separability at early and
  late layers. Camera/image-formation statistics, context, extent, and background
  rejection are major suspects.
- Reverse-transfer asymmetry is the core warning: a real-trained model reads the
  synthetic blend well (`0.866141`), while the pure-synth model learns synthetic
  self-eval (`0.914675`) but transfers poorly (`0.142098`).

Mechanism clues:
- Poisson/contact image formation isolated a useful low-batch positive-transfer
  clue (`0.028350 -> 0.042401`), but worsened empty-frame FPs.
- Source-context replacement is the strongest representation mechanism so far,
  but label safety, inpaint scars, and real-transfer proof remain blockers.
- Reduced mosaic is a useful curriculum clue. `mosaic=0.75` improved small
  bounded-real behavior but still failed class/threshold guards.
- Realistic near-negatives are necessary now. Existing stylized WebGL
  unknown/hard-negative roots are too easy or suppressive. Mined-real negatives
  should teach failure shape, not become leakage-prone training data.
- Old overlap-stage detectors improve mined-real fan/overlap recall but
  overcount and hallucinate more. They support staged curriculum thinking, not
  overlap promotion.

Directions that need a new reason before revisiting:
- Broad stat matching or strict geometry matching without real-transfer proof.
- Naive duplicated fusion of rejected/weak roots.
- Dark negative row banks or target-like zero-label rows without positive-safe
  curriculum controls.
- Tiny row-dose hill-climbing without matched row/class controls and seed repeat.
- Pretty contact-sheet work that does not attack real misses, FPs, or separable
  representation shortcuts.

Candidate directions to consider:
- Diagnose and repair full-frame/extent/background hallucination alongside
  positive recall.
- Use low-dose diversified realistic near-negatives as a teacher for synthetic
  negative design while avoiding val/test leakage.
- Treat source-context replacement and multi-instance replacement as bounded
  mechanism branches only after strict source-remnant audits pass.
- Explore refiner/editor models only through the preservation-first harness.
- If a candidate cannot plausibly close a meaningful part of the target gap,
  convert its lesson into a guardrail and move on.

Refiner contract:
- Raw learned outputs are not trainable data.
- Any refiner must preserve labels, note detail, and edge evidence by design or
  hard recomposition until stricter gates prove relaxation safe.
- Full-size visual QA, composite-edge audit, crop/geometry audit,
  background-realism audit, real-trained detector consistency, fixed-step
  transfer, background-FP guardrail, and per-class guardrail all apply.
- FastCUT/CUT and CycleGAN-Turbo are memory/diagnostic paths. SD-Turbo note-edge
  locking proved the harness can preserve labels, but the current candidate is
  not promoted. Prompt-based editors are small gated smokes only.

## Promotion Gates

A synthetic axis is credible only when it improves or preserves:
- full real val/test;
- clean-visible val/test;
- labeled-positive and geometry-stress slices;
- protected classes, especially riel and high-value notes;
- real empty-frame FP detections and images-with-FP at `conf=0.05`,
  `imgsz=416`, `batch=1`, `device=0`;
- max per-class mAP50-95 drop `<=0.05`, unless explicitly waived;
- at least one seed repeat for serious promotion, more for large claims.

Synthetic package gates are necessary filters, not promotion authority. Self-eval
preservation is not enough. For low-memory probes, use the lightweight transfer
scorecard over multiple confidence thresholds and require no recall regression
plus no FP/background regression.

Clean-base can move toward overlap/fan/hand only when synthetic-only `yolo26n`
is near the target line, clean-visible and labeled-positive test are `>=0.75`,
protected riel passes, real-empty FPs are no worse than control, and the result
survives seed repeat or a slow-promotion run.

## Validation, Labels, And Scope

Validation:
- Full real val/test includes many empty-label images; always pair aggregate AP
  with empty-frame FP probes.
- Roboflow core-13 bridge is a positive KHR/USD judge for the current detector,
  but it is stretched and lacks background pressure.
- Roboflow official21 partial bridge preserves official classes present in the
  source, including `KHR_100`, but current 13-class weights cannot evaluate it.
- Mined-real stress is a warning slice, not release proof. It currently has `17`
  ready stress images and `35` scoreable boxes with narrow class coverage.
- Own-photo capture bridge is empty. High-value gaps are hand fan,
  same-denomination fan, KHR_5000/KHR_20000 thin slices, KHR_5000 face/number
  overlap, KHR_50000 hard positives, mixed USD+KHR stacks, no-note backgrounds,
  and non-banknote paper props.

Labels and class scope:
- Visible evidence is authoritative.
- Detector labels are visible-instance AABBs.
- OBB/quadrilateral metadata is for audits and future oriented/fusion work, not
  today's direct YOLO detect label.
- Fragment/evidence labels are not physical-note counts; count fusion must map
  fragments back to parent notes.
- Human-unidentifiable slivers should be ignore/unknown, not forced
  denominations.
- Zero-label hard-negative roots must remain zero-label; do not silently turn
  foreign/unknown notes into target classes.
- Current active detector scope is 13 operational classes, not all official
  USD/KHR. Run `scripts/check_currency_taxonomy_coverage.py` before class-scope
  claims.
- `KHR_100` is official KHR but outside the current core-13 detector.
- `KHR_50` remains blocked for v1 operational training unless real retail/bank
  capture evidence or an explicit product requirement justifies it.
- Trainable WebGL target-note renders must pass the approved texture-asset gate.

## Repo Hygiene

Documentation:
- Preferred doc shape is one project `AGENTS.md`, this working `model.md`, and
  one user-facing `README.md`.
- No long path inventories, append-only changelogs, stale "active" labels, or
  command dumps here.
- When a script, config, or dataset is no longer active, make that visible in the
  folder or registry. Before moving code/configs, check imports, CLI references,
  docs, and workflow callers with `rg`.

Runtime and harness:
- Work on `master` unless the user asks for a branch.
- Prefer `rl` command prefixes in RunLong.
- Use repo-local runtime storage through `scripts/local_runtime.py`.
- Keep YOLO train/eval caches and generated outputs under repo-local ignored
  paths.
- YOLO promotion posture: train `batch=64`, `workers=0`, `device=0`,
  `cache=false`; eval `batch=64`, `workers=2`; background-FP guardrail
  `batch=1`.
- In Codex/RunLong memory pressure, use smaller diagnostic batches but label them
  clearly. Do not compare low-batch diagnostics to b64 promotion parity.
- WebGL default posture remains `--render-jobs 2 --renderer-batch-size 32
  --check-jobs 4`.
- `cache=disk` is rejected for YOLO probes because it created large `.npy` caches
  and slowed throughput.
