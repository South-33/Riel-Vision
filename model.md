## North Star

Build a small phone/browser-deployable model that counts mixed USD and Khmer
riel from one casual retail photo.

Synthetic transfer is the current bottleneck. Do not move seriously into
overlap/fan/hand until a synthetic-only `yolo26n` can learn normal visible notes
well enough to transfer to real photos.

Hard product requirement later: partial notes, thin edges, overlaps, fans,
stacks, and hand occlusions must count when a human can see denomination
evidence. Counterfeit/authenticity detection is out of scope.

Clean-base target: `0.82-0.85` full real test mAP50-95.

Why that target is real: the near-same-size real-trained `p96_bg96` probe
reaches `0.819153` on full real test and `0.866141` on the 185-image synthetic
blend. If synthetic data is truly camera-real and broad enough, synthetic-only
training should approach that transfer scale.

Current reality:
- Slow synthetic-only filtered185 full real test: `0.142098`.
- Fast fixed-step filtered185 full real test: `0.075907`.
- Current synthetic-only fixed-step aggregate leader: target-anchor
  latest-design transplant `0.144740`.
- Strongest current low-batch mechanism clue: isolated Poisson/contact
  target-anchor `0.028350 -> 0.042401` in the quiet b8/AMP 150-update A/B, but
  it fails empty-frame FP guardrails.

Perspective: we are around `9-14` trying to reach `82-85`, not `80` trying to
reach `85`. Small `+0.01` or `+0.02` wins below `0.25` are clues about a
mechanism, not a trajectory toward done. Stay in step-change mode.

## Current Decision

Stop iterating small negative doses around the same Poisson/contact candidate.
The best next synth-data bet is no longer "prettier background/refiner" alone.
It is an obligation-driven sim-to-real rebuild:

1. Keep Poisson/contact as the current low-edge image-formation base, but use
   alpha/contact as a diagnostic contrast when luma/geometry proxies improve.
2. Drive new recipes from real failure clusters and detector-representation
   gaps, not from renderer knobs that only improve proxy stats.
3. Add a bounded label-preserving learned/AI refiner only when it reduces the
   representation gap and transfer failures, not just visual surface style.
4. Build or source a realistic target-domain near-negative bank, not more
   stylized WebGL line-prop negatives.
5. Promote only through real-transfer, background-FP, per-class, and seed-repeat
   guardrails.

Refiner contract: raw learned outputs are not trainable data. Any learned/AI
refiner output must pass through protected composition first, with note+edge
pixels restored from the trusted source unless a stricter label-preservation
gate proves another policy safe.

The right first learned-refiner path is `FastCUT/CUT` as the low-VRAM sanity
check, then `CycleGAN-Turbo/img2img-turbo` if the harness and memory fit. Use
SD1.5 ControlNet/img2img only as a low-denoise baseline. Do not start with
Qwen/FLUX prompt editing: currency labels and security details are too easy to
mutate, and this laptop has only an RTX 4060 Laptop 8GB VRAM with about 16GB RAM.

Do not blindly scale synthetic yet. Scaling target-anchor latest, realfgstyle,
poseclose, SD-Turbo note-edge, or the existing negative roots as-is is very
unlikely to close the gap to `0.82-0.85`.

Representation-gap read:
- The current `0.144740` synthetic leader is still easy to separate from real
  positives after class-balanced sampling: layer `0` domain accuracy `0.823`,
  layer `8` `0.950`, layer `22` `0.938`.
- Source Poisson/contact m260 is worse through a real-trained lens: layer `0`
  `0.869`, layer `8` `0.977`, layer `22` `0.950`.
- SD-Turbo note-edge did not reduce the gap; it was equal or worse than source
  m260 in most layers (`0.869/0.981/0.965` at layers `0/8/22`).
- Research-grounded diagnostics now available: proxy A-distance/domain
  classifier, MMD, and CORAL-style covariance gap. Treat them as warning
  lights tied to real errors, not standalone promotion metrics.
- Top uncovered real modes are multi-note/scan-like bills, tiny notes in deep
  clutter, flat full-frame rotated note captures, weak KHR back/rare-class
  views, and realistic empty-frame near-negatives. The current generator
  over-represents one-note-on-surface scenes.

Current refiner-readiness status:
- `scripts/build_refiner_readiness_pack.py` prepares the first controlled
  synthetic-to-real refiner smoke pack from isolated Poisson/contact.
- Pack: `runs/cashsnap/refiner_readiness_poisson_contact_v1/`
- It exports note masks, interior/detail lock masks, edge freedom masks,
  train-only real target manifests, strict no-note background manifests, CUDA
  readiness, and 95% headroom-wrapper guidance.
- `scripts/check_refiner_label_preservation.py` is the pre-trainable gate for
  refined outputs. Identity check against the original source images passes:
  `runs/cashsnap/refiner_readiness_poisson_contact_v1/identity_preservation_check.json`.
- `scripts/materialize_refiner_unaligned_dataset.py` turns that pack into a
  CUT/FastCUT-style smoke dataset with `trainA`, `trainB`, labels, and masks.
  Current dataset:
  `runs/cashsnap/refiner_readiness_poisson_contact_v1/cut_unaligned_smoke/`.
  It has 52 synthetic `trainA`/`train_A` rows, 160 train-only real
  `trainB`/`train_B` rows, 8 train-only `test_A`/`test_B` rows for refiner
  smoke validation, fixed CycleGAN-Turbo prompts, and its own identity
  preservation check passes.
- CUT/FastCUT repo was cloned into ignored
  `.cache_runtime/third_party/contrastive-unpaired-translation`; dependencies
  are installed after downgrading `setuptools` to restore `pkg_resources` for
  `visdom` on Python 3.14. The cached CUT argparse bug for `--CUT_mode` was
  patched locally.
- Tiny FastCUT GPU/headroom proof succeeded:
  `runs/cashsnap/refiner_checkpoints/cashsnap_fastcut_poisson_smoke_e1_m8_128/`.
  It used CUDA `gpu_ids=0`, 8 images, 1 epoch, 128px, batch 1, smaller
  `resnet_6blocks/ngf32/ndf32`, no flip, no HTML/visdom, and checkpoints under
  `runs/cashsnap`.
- Shape-preserving inference succeeded:
  `runs/cashsnap/refiner_results/cashsnap_fastcut_poisson_smoke_e1_m8_128/train_latest/images/fake_B/`
  emits 640x640 outputs. It is not a usable refiner candidate: label
  preservation on first 8 fails all rows, with detail L1 mean `51.104` and max
  `88.984`.
- `scripts/apply_refiner_detail_lock.py` can restore source note pixels after
  refiner inference. Detail-lock recomposite cuts detail L1 to mean `0.692` but
  still fails 4/8 on edge/note thresholds. Full-note lock gives detail/note L1
  `0.0` but still has one edge-only failure and visual output remains poor on
  the toy run.
- Cached CUT now has a local `--lambda_detail_identity` mask-aware training
  loss wired from `masks/detail_lock`. A tiny FastCUT 8-image smoke at lambda
  `10` still failed all rows (`detail_l1` mean `58.064`); a stronger lambda
  `200`, 5-epoch smoke also failed all rows (`detail_l1` mean `52.125`). Read:
  mask-aware loss is wired but not enough to trust raw FastCUT outputs at toy
  scale.
- `scripts/apply_refiner_detail_lock.py --lock-mask note_edge --feather-px 0`
  restores the note plus contact edge band after refiner inference. On the
  stronger FastCUT smoke it passes the strict first-8 preservation gate with
  `0/8` failures and detail/note/edge L1 all `0.0`. This is the current safe
  refiner contract: learned model may alter background/broad tone, but protected
  note and edge pixels come from source unless a future gate proves relaxation
  safe.
- A 52-image note-edge-locked FastCUT candidate was materialized as a normal
  YOLO root:
  `runs/cashsnap/refiner_yolo_candidates/fastcut_maskid200_note_edge_e5_m52_128/`.
  It passes strict preservation (`0/52` failures), `check_yolo_dataset.py`, and
  numeric visual QA, but human sheet review rejects it: backgrounds collapse
  into gray/green/purple translator artifacts.
- `scripts/check_refiner_background_realism.py` now compares candidate
  background pixels outside note+edge masks to strict no-note CashSnap
  backgrounds. The original Poisson/contact `trainA` source passes; the
  note-edge-locked FastCUT candidate fails with `luma_std_ratio=0.176884`
  against the default `>=0.45` guard. Do not promote this FastCUT candidate.
- `scripts/run_sd_turbo_img2img_refiner.py` is the first local AI-image-refiner
  proof path. It runs `stabilityai/sd-turbo` img2img on CUDA/fp16 and refuses
  CPU fallback. Low denoise `strength=0.25`, `steps=4`, `guidance=0` is one
  effective denoise step on this setup.
- Raw SD-Turbo is not label-safe: on the 260-image audit pack it failed
  preservation on `257/260` rows (`detail_l1` mean `22.012`, `note_l1` mean
  `20.450`). The prompt does not reliably preserve denomination detail.
- Note-edge-locked SD-Turbo is the first viable AI-refiner candidate branch:
  `runs/cashsnap/refiner_yolo_candidates/sd_turbo_note_edge_s025_steps4_m260/`
  has 260 images, 20 per class, passes strict preservation (`0/260` failures),
  background realism (`luma_std_ratio=1.060475`, no violations),
  `check_yolo_dataset.py`, visual QA numeric gates, and composite-edge audit
  (`boundary_ratio_mean=1.2708`, `edge_color_step_mean=0.0759`).
- Full-size visual QA on SD-Turbo m260 is mixed: several clean-counter images
  are plausible, but some outputs have pastel/blocky AI background patches,
  washed/haloed notes from the hard edge lock, or bad source backgrounds such as
  speckled black patches. Treat it as a promising audit candidate, not a
  trainable/done package.
- Model-side b4 fixed-step source-vs-SD m260 same-root learnability rejected
  this exact SD setting: source `0.736527`, SD-Turbo `0.672436`, delta
  `-0.064091`, with 7 classes worse than the `0.05` per-class guard and worst
  `KHR_10000 -0.176763`. The b8 run hit the 95% RAM guard on the SD candidate,
  so use b4 for this bounded comparison. This is not real transfer proof; it is
  an early "do not promote as-is" signal.
- Better-model research branch to keep current: test ICEdit, Qwen-Image-Edit,
  FLUX.1/FLUX.2 editing variants, Step1X-Edit, and OmniGen2 only through this
  same preservation-first harness. Do not trust model-card claims of detail
  preservation; raw output must pass masks/OCR/detail checks or be used only
  with note+edge recomposition.
- CycleGAN-Turbo/img2img-turbo repo was cloned into ignored
  `.cache_runtime/third_party/img2img-turbo`. Core deps now import
  (`accelerate`, `diffusers`, `transformers`, `peft`, `lpips`, `clean-fid`,
  `vision_aided_loss`, `wandb`, `open_clip`); `xformers` is still absent and
  must not be enabled.
- Cached CycleGAN-Turbo patches for laptop smoke: `--report_to none`, no
  validation/FID/DINO when `--validation_steps 0 --validation_num_images 0`,
  skip LPIPS/VGG when LPIPS weights are zero, and add `resize_128/resize_192`.
- CycleGAN-Turbo 256px one-step crossed the guard and was killed at GPU memory
  `96%`; do not use 256px default on this laptop yet.
- Optimized CycleGAN-Turbo 128px one-step completed under headroom with
  batch `1`, workers `0`, low LoRA rank, no validation, no LPIPS:
  `runs/cashsnap/cyclegan_turbo_smoke_s1_128_noval_nolpips/`. It did not save a
  checkpoint because the upstream save condition misses step 1 when
  `checkpointing_steps=1`.
- Rerunning the 128px smoke with a step-1 checkpoint request hit the 95% GPU
  memory guard during setup. Treat CycleGAN-Turbo as barely fitting: usable for
  tiny proof runs only until the harness gets a real lower-memory/autocast or
  offload path.
- An fp16 attempt failed with `Attempting to unscale FP16 gradients`; do not use
  `--mixed_precision fp16` for this cached unpaired trainer until the loop is
  rewritten around proper autocast instead of casting trainable weights.
- Latest hardware read inside the pack: CUDA OK on `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060
  Laptop GPU`; low available RAM warned and recommended `256px`, batch `1`,
  fp16/AMP, workers `0`. Use `scripts/run_with_headroom.py` for long refiner
  training/inference so CPU/RAM/GPU-memory caps stay at or below 95%.

## Current Read

- Renderer mechanics and package QA are strong enough for bounded probes, but
  renderer gates are not transfer proof.
- The current `0.144740` synthetic leader misses `669/817` real-test GT boxes
  at `conf=0.05` (`81.88%` miss rate) and still fires on `174/748` empty test
  images (`292` detections). This is not close; it is a distribution failure.
- The detector can identify synthetic-vs-real positives from internal
  activations even after class balancing. The gap appears immediately at early
  layers, so camera/image-formation statistics and context modes are major
  suspects, not only late denomination semantics.
- The main blocker is real transfer: target-domain foreground/camera pixels,
  pasted-edge/contact/focus consistency, realistic target-vs-non-target
  banknote pressure, rare-class/capture gaps, and validation obligations tied to
  real failures.
- Target-anchor latest was the first clear recent mechanism signal because it
  combines real CashSnap no-note pixels, real CashSnap geometry, and
  latest-design target assets. It is a direction signal, not a solved package.
- Latest-design texture policy matters. The all-manifest target-anchor MVP
  improved aggregate but failed class guards, likely by mixing old/current class
  appearances.
- Poisson/contact image formation is useful. Isolated Poisson/contact improved
  low-batch positive transfer, but it increased real-empty false positives.
- Close-up pose/scale did not transfer. It reduced empty-frame FPs but broke
  positive transfer, especially `KHR_10000`.
- Existing synthetic negative pools are too stylized/easy. At `conf=0.05`, the
  Poisson/contact b8 model had zero FPs on the current unknown/hard-negative
  synthetic roots; they do not match real empty-frame failures.
- Full CashSnap empty-label frames are hard negatives, not clean positive
  canvases. Many contain visible foreign/unknown/target-like notes. Use strict
  no-note patches for positive transplants; use full empty frames for FP
  diagnostics and target-vs-non-target pressure.
- Bridge-calibrated selected-v1 proved that prettier summary stats can still
  train a worse detector. Domain separators and visual-gap audits are warning
  lights, not judges.
- Promoted real fan/overlap/hand proof is still incomplete. The curated real
  benchmark has only one labeled mild-overlap image today, while the mined-real
  diagnostic path has `17` scoreable stress images and `35` boxes. Use the mined
  set as a validation warning slice, not release-grade proof: it has no
  hand-occlusion rows, narrow class coverage, and mixed CashSnap source splits.
- Before class-scope claims, run `scripts/check_currency_taxonomy_coverage.py`.

## Next Bet: Representation-Guided Synthesis

Goal: rebuild the synthetic curriculum around real modes that the detector says
are uncovered, then prove the new branch reduces both real errors and
representation separability.

Immediate obligations from the current leader:
- Broad positive recall: `669/817` missed real-test GTs at `conf=0.05`.
- Weak classes: `USD_5`, `USD_50`, `USD_100`, `KHR_1000`, `KHR_2000`,
  `KHR_5000`, `KHR_10000`, `KHR_20000`.
- Empty-frame pressure: `174/748` empty test images with FPs, dominated by
  `USD_20`, `USD_10`, `KHR_50000`, `KHR_2000`, `KHR_500`, and `USD_1`.
- Image-formation modes: multi-note scan-like bills, tiny notes in deep clutter,
  flat full-frame rotated captures, weak KHR backs, and rare-class views.

Next engineering move:
1. Turn the inpaint-context mechanism signal into a cleaner generator by
   coupling each background to the same train-anchor geometry it came from, so
   the synthetic note covers the erased real note region instead of landing on a
   random inpaint scar.
2. Then rerun representation-gap, positive-error, background-FP, and a clean
   fixed-step A/B under lower memory pressure before any scale-up.
3. Keep the analog-geometry branch as evidence that geometry alone is not
   enough; context/image formation is the active bottleneck.

Train-only analog mining status:
- `scripts/mine_representation_gap_train_analogs.py` maps the top uncovered
  real-test representation rows to same-class train-split anchors.
- Current run:
  `runs/cashsnap/representation_gap_synthleader_train_analogs_v1/summary.json`.
- It found `151` unique train anchors for `40` uncovered test queries from a
  `2,813`-image train-positive candidate pool, with visible analogs for
  scan-like/multi-note USD/KHR, flat rotated notes, hand-held views, tiny dark
  background shots, KHR backs, and weak rare-class views.
- Use these train anchors as the next generator target/geometry context source;
  do not use the uncovered test images themselves for training data.

Targeted branch status:
- Analog-geometry branch:
  `data/synthetic/cashsnap_target_anchor_transplant_rep_gap_analogs_v1/`.
  Dataset, visual QA, and edge audit pass, but representation gap is mixed:
  early layers got worse (`layer0 0.823 -> 0.877`) while late layer improved
  (`layer22 0.938 -> 0.904`). Read: geometry helps semantics but strict
  no-note patch contexts still scream synthetic.
- Inpaint-context branch:
  `data/synthetic/cashsnap_target_anchor_transplant_rep_gap_inpaintctx_v1/`.
  Built from `58` filtered train-only inpainted anchor backgrounds and the same
  train-anchor geometry. Dataset and numeric visual QA pass; edge color step is
  higher (`0.0996`), and full-size review shows some inpaint seams/halos.
- Inpaint-context representation result is the first strong mechanism signal:
  layer `0` domain accuracy `0.823 -> 0.808`, layer `1` `0.877 -> 0.823`,
  layer `22` `0.938 -> 0.862`, and late MMD `0.0992 -> 0.0414`. Read: real
  train-context canvases directly attack the measured image-formation gap.
- Coupled-context branch:
  `data/synthetic/cashsnap_target_anchor_transplant_rep_gap_couplectx_v1/`.
  It reuses each inpainted background's source-image geometry so the synthetic
  note covers the erased real note region. Dataset/QA pass, but edge boundary
  ratio is high (`1.4016`) and representation is mixed: early layers improve
  strongly (`layer0 0.808 -> 0.773`, MMD `0.1050 -> 0.0624` versus inpaintctx),
  while late domain accuracy worsens (`layer22 0.862 -> 0.888`). Read: coupling
  reduces camera/context distance but exposes a note-edge/presentation shortcut.
- Strict inpaint filtering (`max_mask_fraction=0.35`) is rejected. It kept only
  `32` contexts, collapsed class-specific source coverage, worsened edge audit
  (`boundary_ratio=1.5176`, `color_step=0.1122`), and worsened representation
  separation (`layer22=0.9538`).
- Alpha-feathered coupled branch:
  `data/synthetic/cashsnap_target_anchor_transplant_rep_gap_couplectx_feather08_v1/`.
  MMD/centroids improve further and `layer19` domain accuracy reaches `0.846`,
  but edge boundary ratio rises (`1.6120`) and `layer22` domain accuracy worsens
  to `0.9077`. Keep as a diagnostic knob, not a promotion path.
- Dynamic source-context branch:
  `data/synthetic/cashsnap_target_anchor_transplant_rep_gap_sourcectx_dyninpaint_v1/`.
  It uses the real train anchor image itself, couples source geometry, and
  inpaints only under the warped synthetic note. This gives the strongest
  representation signal so far (`layer22 0.938 -> 0.731`, MMD `0.0992 -> 0.0241`)
  and better edge stats (`boundary=1.2876`, `color_step=0.0680`), but visual QA
  shows unlabeled real-note remnants/extra notes. Treat it as mechanism proof,
  not training data.
- Source-box/singlebox variant:
  `data/synthetic/cashsnap_target_anchor_transplant_rep_gap_sourcectx_singlebox_v1/`.
  It also inpaints the sampled source YOLO box and filters manifest backgrounds
  to `<=1` source label. The filter kept all `151` anchors, meaning source
  labels do not expose all visually present currency. Visual leakage is reduced
  but inpaint bands remain. Representation is still strong (`layer22=0.7769`,
  `layer0=0.6538`), so source-context replacement is now the best mechanism
  direction, with label-safety/erase quality as the blocker.
- Detector label-safety audit now quantifies that blocker. Using the current
  real-clean detector at `conf=0.05` and unmatched IoU `<0.10`, inpaint-context
  has `6/260` suspect images and `8` unmatched predictions, while
  sourcectx-singlebox has `23/260` suspect images and `26` unmatched
  predictions. The representation win is partly buying real-note leakage or
  detector-visible source remnants, so source-context must be filtered,
  re-erased, or gated before it can become training data.
- Audit-clean sourcectx-singlebox:
  `configs/webgl_ablation/cashsnap_target_anchor_transplant_rep_gap_sourcectx_singlebox_auditclean_puresynth_realval_v1.yaml`.
  It excludes the `23` detector-suspect composites and keeps `237/260` images;
  rerunning the same unlabeled-prediction audit gives `0` suspect images and
  `0` unmatched predictions. The representation win mostly survives but is no
  longer as extreme: layer `0=0.6846`, layer `1=0.7346`, layer `8=0.9077`,
  layer `22=0.8346`, late MMD `0.0227`. Read: leakage helped the unfiltered
  score, but source-context replacement is still materially closer to real than
  inpaintctx (`layer22=0.8615`) and the current leader (`0.9385`). Treat this
  as a safer diagnostic branch, not a trainable promotion, because USD_50 and
  USD_100 are down to `13` images and USD_20/KHR_5000 to `16`.
- Overgen-filter-rebalanced sourcectx-singlebox:
  `configs/webgl_ablation/cashsnap_target_anchor_transplant_rep_gap_sourcectx_singlebox_overgen40_auditclean_balanced20_puresynth_realval_v1.yaml`.
  Generated `520` images at `40/class`, detector-audited out `67` suspects,
  kept `453` clean images with a `22` image minimum class floor, then selected a
  balanced `260` image, `20/class` train list. Final detector audit is `0`
  suspect images and `0` unmatched predictions. Representation remains the best
  label-clean branch so far: layer `0=0.6846`, `1=0.7538`, `8=0.9231`,
  `13=0.8346`, `19=0.8000`, `22=0.8154`, late MMD `0.0205`. Read: source
  context is still the strongest measured mechanism after removing obvious
  source-note leakage and restoring class balance.
- Strict coverage audit caught a second leakage mode: large leftover source
  notes that overlap the intended label enough to pass the IoU-only audit. With
  `--min-prediction-coverage 0.50`, the overgen40 balanced candidate still had
  `18/260` suspect images and `24` unmatched predictions. Do not use IoU-only
  unlabeled audits for source-context promotion.
- Strict overgen60 sourcectx-singlebox:
  `configs/webgl_ablation/cashsnap_target_anchor_transplant_rep_gap_sourcectx_singlebox_overgen60_strictclean_balanced20_puresynth_realval_v1.yaml`.
  Generated `780` images at `60/class`, strict-audited out `117` suspects, kept
  `663` clean images, and selected a balanced `260` image, `20/class` train
  list. Final strict audit is `0` suspect images and `0` unmatched predictions.
  Visual sheet is improved on giant source-note remnants, but still shows
  hard inpaint panels/context scars, so this is bounded-probe material, not a
  perfect/done pipeline. Representation is label-safe but less dramatic than
  the IoU-only branch: layer `0=0.7231`, `1=0.7654`, `8=0.9308`, `13=0.8769`,
  `19=0.8231`, `22=0.8577`, late MMD `0.0293`. Read: strict source-context is
  about tied with inpaintctx on late domain accuracy, better on late MMD, and
  much safer on unlabeled-target leakage.
- Detector-erased source-background diagnostic:
  `scripts/build_yolo_inpainted_background_bank.py` can now add detector boxes
  to the erase mask before inpainting source backgrounds. The first detector
  bank kept `88/151` train anchors and skipped `63` high-mask images, but the
  resulting `detectorerasectx_v1` composite is rejected: dataset check passes,
  yet strict composite audit still finds `26/260` suspect images and visual QA
  shows large source-note remnants. Read: pre-erasing with the current detector
  is not sufficient because the detector misses some visible source notes; the
  final strict composite audit remains mandatory.
- Source-anchor strict audit diagnostic: `scripts/audit_yolo_unlabeled_predictions.py`
  now accepts `--manifest`, and `scripts/filter_jsonl_manifest_by_unlabeled_audit.py`
  can remove suspect JSONL rows. The mined train-anchor manifest has `18/151`
  strict source-level suspects; filtering keeps `133`. Building
  `sourcectx_sourceclean_v1` from that manifest still fails final strict
  composite audit (`23/260` suspect images, `32` unmatched predictions). Read:
  source-level filtering helps explain the leak but does not replace final
  composite filtering; source context can become unsafe after placement/overlap.
- Larger source-box erase padding is rejected. `sourcectx_pad20_v1` changes
  `inpaint_source_box_pad_fraction` from `0.02` to `0.20`, passes dataset
  checks, but strict composite audit worsens to `53/260` suspect images and
  `73` unmatched predictions. Read: broad rectangular erase creates stronger
  artifacts/leak signatures; do not pursue padding alone as the fix.
- Source-context inpaint geometry is now measurable before detector audit.
  `build_cashsnap_target_anchor_transplant.py` emits foreground/source-box/final
  inpaint mask fractions and can optionally reject/retry rows by those metrics.
  `scripts/check_target_anchor_inpaint_metadata.py` gates broad source erasures;
  `scripts/filter_jsonl_manifest_by_yolo_geometry.py` filters train-anchor
  manifests by source YOLO box size. The original 151-anchor manifest has `59`
  boxes over `0.50` area and `24` over `0.80`; `boxarea90` keeps `140` and
  removes `11` worst near-full-frame sources. A 13-image sourcectx smoke still
  failed the source-context geometry gate, while a loose row-gated smoke
  improved `p95` final inpaint fraction from `0.933` to `0.837` and
  mask/foreground ratio from `10.68` to `5.88`, but still flags USD_1 full-frame
  anchors. Read: source-context should become class/anchor-aware with fallback
  for full-frame source positives, not a universal rectangular erase recipe.
- Class-aware fallback source-context now exists as a safer proxy branch:
  `sourcectx_boxarea90_fallback_metagated_strict_v1` uses filtered source
  anchors where class coverage is sufficient, strict no-note patch fallback for
  USD_1/KHR_5000/KHR_20000/KHR_50000, source-box erase only on source-positive
  backgrounds, and generation-time inpaint row limits. Full root is `780`
  images (`540` source-positive, `240` no-note fallback) and passes dataset plus
  inpaint metadata gates. Strict detector audit still removed `64/780` suspect
  rows; the audit-clean set kept `716`, with weakest classes USD_50 `35` and
  USD_100 `39`, then balanced cleanly to `260` (`20/class`). Final strict audit
  on the balanced package is `0/260` suspect, `0` unmatched, and exact split
  inpaint metadata gate passes on the list-backed config. Edge audit: boundary
  ratio `1.3089`, edge color step `0.0876`. Representation is safer but mixed
  vs previous strict sourcectx: layer22 domain accuracy improves
  `0.8577 -> 0.8269`, but layer22 MMD worsens `0.0293 -> 0.0332` and early
  covariance/MMD is worse from fallback no-note rows. Treat as a better
  label-safe bounded-probe branch, not transfer proof or done data.
- USD-risk source fallback is a useful safety ablation, not the stronger proxy.
  `sourcectx_usdriskfallback_metagated_strict_v1` forces USD_20/USD_50/USD_100
  to no-note fallback after the prior full-root audit showed those classes
  caused `60/64` source-positive suspects. Full-root strict audit improves to
  only `4/780` suspect images (`5` unmatched); audit-clean keeps `776`, and the
  balanced `260` package passes dataset, exact inpaint metadata, and final
  strict detector audits (`0/260`, `0` unmatched). Cost: more no-note fallback
  weakens representation substantially vs the non-USD-risk fallback: layer22
  domain accuracy/MMD `0.8462/0.0437` vs `0.8269/0.0332`, and early layers are
  worse (`layer0 0.7962/0.1372`). Edge audit is also rougher
  (`boundary=1.3669`, `color_step=0.0960`). Keep as leak-minimized diagnostic;
  do not prefer it over the non-USD-risk fallback unless label leakage becomes
  the dominant blocker in model probes.
- Narrow USD_50/USD_100 fallback is the best current safety/signal compromise.
  `sourcectx_usd50100fallback_metagated_strict_v1` keeps USD_20 source context
  but forces USD_50/USD_100 to no-note fallback. Full-root strict audit drops to
  `13/780` suspect images (`14` unmatched), audit-clean keeps `767`, and the
  balanced `260` package passes dataset, exact inpaint metadata, and final
  strict detector audits (`0/260`, `0` unmatched). Representation sits between
  the two fallback extremes: layer22 domain accuracy is best of the current
  safe fallback set (`0.8231`), but layer22 MMD is worse (`0.0442`) and early
  layers are weaker than non-risk fallback. Edge audit is also rougher
  (`boundary=1.3578`, `color_step=0.0938`). Prefer this branch when pre-filter
  label cleanliness matters more; prefer non-risk fallback when late MMD/early
  representation gap matters more. Neither is transfer proof.
- Model-side status: real-transfer proof is still blocked by RAM headroom, not
  by data wiring. Full latest-baseline `416/b2` train-only probe failed at the
  RAM guard while scanning/training the `1,248` row baseline. A row-matched
  latest `260` image, `20/class` baseline was built, but `416/b2` still hit the
  guard at train start. A reduced `320/b1`, `150`-batch row-matched train did
  complete and produced weights for both arms, but its built-in comparison used
  train-only YAML self-eval, not real transfer: candidate synthetic self
  mAP50-95 `0.005647` vs baseline `0.005095` (`+0.000552`). Real CashSnap test
  validation of those weights was attempted and blocked immediately by RAM
  (`~97%`, `~0.5GB` free). A later retry after RAM recovered to `83.4%` still
  tripped the guard when the `1,562` image test cache/eval loaded, even at
  batch `1`. Do not cite the `320/b1` self-eval as transfer proof; rerun
  real-test eval when memory headroom is available.
- Bounded real-test subset support now exists:
  `scripts/materialize_yolo_split_balanced_eval_subset.py` wrote
  `cashsnap_v1_realtest_balanced10_bg50_v1` with `179` test images (`10/class`
  plus `50` backgrounds). Validation on this smaller real slice still tripped
  the RAM guard before metrics at current headroom (`92.2%` RAM, `1.19GB`
  free), but the config is ready for the next lower-memory window.
- Lightweight streaming real eval now bypasses the heavy Ultralytics validator:
  `scripts/eval_yolo_lightweight_real_recall.py` ran on the bounded real-test
  slice for the `320/b1/150` row-matched weights. Result is negative/too weak:
  at `conf=0.05` both models have `0.0` recall; sourcectx adds `1/50`
  background FP while baseline has `0/50`. At `conf=0.01` both still have
  `0.0` recall and `2/50` background FPs. At `conf=0.001`, baseline recall is
  `0.7615` and sourcectx `0.7385`, but both fire on all `50/50` backgrounds
  with precision about `0.0018`. Read: the low-res short probe is undertrained
  and uncalibrated; it does not prove strict sourcectx transfer.
- Stronger `320/b1/1000` row-matched sourcectx fallback probes completed under
  recovered RAM. Both candidates beat the same reused latest-anchor baseline on
  train-only synthetic self-eval, but neither shows trustworthy real transfer:
  `usd50100fallback` self mAP50-95 `0.011406` vs baseline `0.007368`
  (`+0.004038`), and `boxarea90fallback` `0.009140` (`+0.001773`).
  On bounded real-test `cashsnap_v1_realtest_balanced10_bg50_v1`, all arms have
  `0.0` recall at `conf=0.05`; at `conf=0.01`, both sourcectx candidates find
  only `1/130` GT (`recall=0.0077`) while baseline finds `0`, with weak
  precision (`0.0046` usd50100, `0.0110` boxarea90). At `conf=0.001`, baseline
  recall is higher (`0.7692`) than usd50100 (`0.7308`) or boxarea90 (`0.7231`),
  but all fire on `50/50` backgrounds with precision about `0.0018-0.0019`.
  Read: representation/self-eval wins are not sufficient; keep both sourcectx
  fallback branches diagnostic-only.
- Lightweight real-eval v2 diagnostics show the transfer failure shape is
  mostly extent/background rejection, not only class appearance. At `conf=0.01`
  the false-positive mean area ratio is enormous (`0.856` baseline, `0.874`
  usd50100, `0.839` boxarea90); most FPs cover at least half the image
  (`155/188`, `185/215`, `76/90`), and many are near-full-frame (`139/188`,
  `158/215`, `53/90`). Source-wise, `boxarea90` cuts `cashcountingxl` FPs
  (`73 -> 19`) and background-hit families, but still gets only one true
  positive. Next synth work should explicitly train/gate object extent and
  empty-background rejection, not just push more realistic positive context.
- Geometry-scaled target-anchor probes show that extent/luma proxy gains are
  real but still insufficient. `geoscale205_minshort190` repaired candidate
  object size (p05 short side about `130-138px` at 416; aggregate geometry
  area delta roughly `-0.21`) but Poisson/contact crops stayed too dark
  (`luma_mean -0.105`). Removing `real_crop_stats` did not solve it
  (`luma_mean -0.098`, crop separator AUC `0.929`). A first
  `poisson_mixed_lumaguard` improved luma (`-0.050`) but made pasted edges
  obvious (`edge_color_step_mean 0.214`); the tuned guard was still an
  edge/proxy compromise (`luma_mean -0.087`, edge `0.131`).
- Best geometry/luma diagnostic from this pass is
  `alpha_contact_geoscale205_minshort190_bal20`: crop luma is near the older
  target-anchor leader (`-0.031` vs `-0.025`), crop separator improves to
  `0.859`, box separator to `0.792`, and geometry aggregate improves to
  `box_area -0.194`, `width -0.148`, `height -0.168`, `aspect -0.004`.
  However, fixed-step `320/b1/1000` synthetic self-eval is slightly down
  (`0.007190` vs baseline `0.007368`, delta `-0.000178`). Bounded real eval:
  `conf=0.05` recall `0.0`, bg FP `0/50`; `conf=0.01` recall `0.0154`
  (`2/130` GT), precision `0.0144`, bg FP `7/50`; `conf=0.001` recall
  `0.7462`, precision `0.0018`, bg FP `50/50`. Do not promote it; keep it as
  evidence that scale/tone helps a little, while calibration/full-frame FP
  rejection remains the blocker.
- FP-mined real-negative diagnostics prove the background-rejection lever but
  not a trainable recipe yet. A concentrated top-25 alpha/geoscale dose from
  train-split empty-label FPs improved synthetic self-eval slightly
  (`+0.000180`) and cut `conf=0.01` bounded-real FPs (`137 -> 74`, full-frame
  `102 -> 39`, bg FP `7/50 -> 4/50`), but erased the two real true positives
  (`recall 0.0154 -> 0.0`). A diversified spread-8 dose is the better clue:
  self-eval `+0.001666`, bounded-real `conf=0.01` keeps recall `0.0154`
  (`2/130`), raises precision `0.0144 -> 0.0339`, and cuts FPs `137 -> 57`,
  full-frame FPs `102 -> 31`, and bg FPs `7/50 -> 5/50`. Read: use low-dose,
  diversified realistic near-negatives; blunt zero-label pressure suppresses
  positives. The lightweight scorecard still rejects both mined-real doses for
  promotion: spread-8 passes aggregate FP pressure but loses the lone `KHR_500`
  TP at `conf=0.01` and has multi-class recall swaps at `conf=0.001`; top-25
  loses both low-confidence TPs at `conf=0.01`. Treat mined negatives as a
  teacher for FP shape, not a recipe. Next step is synthetic/curated
  near-negatives that mimic these hard real modes without depending on test
  leakage.
- `webgl_unknown_currency_fullframe_negative_v1` is now the first synthetic
  attempt to mimic the mined near-negative failure: one dominant full-frame
  unknown banknote-like prop plus softer clutter, zero target assets, and a
  hard-negative diversity gate requiring `fullframe`. The 16-image smoke passes
  (`47` props, `24` unknown_banknote, `16` fullframe, zero assets). Low WebGL
  full-frame doses reduce FP extent but do not yet match mined-real pressure:
  dose-8 self-eval `+0.000505`, bounded `conf=0.01` bg FP `5/50`, FPs `68`,
  full-frame FPs `22`, but recall `0/130`; dose-4 self-eval `+0.001584`,
  bounded recall `1/130`, bg FP `8/50`, FPs `65`, full-frame FPs `19`. Read:
  the synthetic axis has the right geometric target but the prop texture/domain
  is still too artificial or too suppressive. Keep the policy diagnostic and
  use mined spread-8 as the teacher for the next full-frame negative realism
  pass.
- Negative FP visual-gap audit now quantifies that mismatch:
  `runs/cashsnap/negative_fp_visual_gap_alpha_geoscale_mined_vs_webglfullframe_v1.json`
  compares `40` mined alpha/geoscale real FP review crops with `16` WebGL
  full-frame negatives. Synthetic-minus-real crop deltas are luma mean `+0.303`,
  luma p05 `+0.318`, luma p95 `+0.510`, saturation std `-0.272`, and box area
  `+0.174`. Read: the current synthetic full-frame negatives are tabletop-bright
  and low color-variation against the mined teacher; fix exposure/color/texture
  before another dose sweep.
- `webgl_unknown_currency_fullframe_dark_negative_v1` is the first correction:
  same 16-image/full-frame/zero-asset gate, but with `mined_fp_dark_v1` camera
  ISP and darker unknown-banknote texture. It passes hard-negative diversity
  (`47` props, `24` unknown_banknote, `16` fullframe, zero assets), and the
  visual-gap audit at
  `runs/cashsnap/negative_fp_visual_gap_alpha_geoscale_mined_vs_webglfullframedark_v1.json`
  improves crop deltas to luma mean `-0.049`, luma p05 `+0.023`, luma p95
  `+0.114`, saturation std `-0.093`, and box area `+0.174`. Read: exposure is
  now teacher-like enough for a bounded dose probe; color variation still needs
  another realism pass if the model probe remains suppressive.
- Dark full-frame dose probes proved that the better-looking correction is
  still too semantically strong as zero-label training. Dose-4 self-eval fails
  (`0.003629` vs `0.007368`, delta `-0.003739`, worst `KHR_5000 -0.015747`),
  and dose-1 also fails (`0.003702`, delta `-0.003666`, worst `KHR_5000
  -0.015564`). Do not scale this dark full-frame recipe. The next synthetic
  negative should keep the mined-FP camera/exposure statistics but soften the
  target-like semantics: partial/off-center unknown notes, less dominant
  full-frame banknote texture, and more receipts/cards/patterned paper/foreign
  clutter, with positive-preserving guardrails before any bounded real run.
- `unknown_currency_soft_dark_v1` tested that softer semantic shape. The
  camera-only soft-dark root stayed too bright (`crop luma_mean +0.086`), so
  the renderer now has a soft dark policy that uses mined-FP dark surfaces and
  dark unknown-note palettes without full-frame hardness. Its 16-image v2 root
  passes diversity (`63` props, `59` textured, `21` unknown_banknote,
  `soft/coin/none` hardness, zero assets), and visual-gap audit improves to
  crop luma mean `-0.070`, luma p05 `+0.023`, luma p95 `-0.043`, saturation
  std `-0.139`, box area `+0.174`. Model-side result is still reject: dose-4
  self-eval `0.004152` (delta `-0.003216`, worst `KHR_5000 -0.014010`) and
  dose-1 `0.003690` (delta `-0.003678`, worst `KHR_5000 -0.015580`). Read:
  negative-only dark banknote-like pixels are an anti-curriculum in balanced20,
  even when visually plausible and soft. Do not run bounded real for these
  doses. Next step is matched dark positive support and/or negative-loss/sampling
  strategy, not more raw zero-label dark-negative variants.
- Spread-dark WebGL negatives also failed the row-bank path. The new
  `unknown_currency_spread_dark_v1` policy avoids one mandatory full-frame note
  and spreads partial/off-center dark unknown notes among receipts, cards,
  patterned paper, wallets, and coins. Its 16-image root passes hard-negative
  diversity (`79` props, `21` unknown_banknote, `44` none, `10` partial,
  `11` soft, `10` coin) and the mined-FP visual-gap audit is teacher-like on
  luma (`crop luma_mean -0.068`, `p05 +0.023`, `p95 -0.025`), though saturation
  variation is still low (`saturation_std -0.130`). Dose-1 fixed-step self-eval
  fails almost identically to the other dark-negative rows (`0.003722` vs
  `0.007368`, delta `-0.003646`, worst `KHR_5000 -0.015551`). Do not probe
  dose-4 or bounded real for spread-dark. The blocker is not just dominant
  full-frame semantics; raw dark zero-label near-currency pixels are still an
  anti-curriculum in this balanced20 setup.
- Matched dark positive support did not rescue the dark-domain path in the
  balanced20 self-eval. WebGL dark positives added at 1/class failed
  (`0.005075` vs `0.007368`, delta `-0.002293`, worst `KHR_5000 -0.013065`);
  2/class failed harder (`0.004289`, delta `-0.003079`, worst `KHR_5000
  -0.015307`). A label-preserving trusted-source style-copy probe also failed:
  one mined-FP-dark transform per class from the alpha/contact positives scored
  `0.004265` (delta `-0.003103`, worst `KHR_5000 -0.014746`). Read: this is
  not just WebGL geometry or negative-only labels; raw dark-domain row insertion
  destabilizes the tiny balanced20 curriculum. Do not combine dark positives
  with dark negatives yet. The next path is a calibrated style ladder,
  augmentation schedule, or loss/sampling curriculum that proves self-eval
  preservation before bounded real transfer.
- The first calibrated style/curriculum pass keeps that rejection intact. A
  label-preserving style ladder shows the support crops moving monotonically
  darker than real train crops: mild support luma mean `-0.116`, medium
  `-0.192`, strong `-0.270` vs sampled real train; saturation mean moves from
  `-0.000` to `+0.043` to `+0.184`. Mild is the only rung worth model probing,
  but it still fails self-eval (`0.004603`, delta `-0.002764`, worst
  `KHR_5000 -0.014811`). Do not model-probe medium/strong style rows unless a
  better support selection or gentler transform is designed.
- Candidate-only training augmentation is a better-shaped knob than row-level
  dark support, but not a promotion yet. `hsv_v=0.7` on target-anchor latest
  balanced20 preserves fixed-step self-eval (`0.007401` vs `0.007368`, delta
  `+0.000033`, worst `KHR_5000 -0.010736`) while `hsv_v=0.55` fails
  (`0.006194`, delta `-0.001174`, worst `KHR_5000 -0.011108`). Bounded real
  says `hsv_v=0.7` is only a noisy clue: at `conf=0.01` it raises recall from
  `0/130` to `2/130` but worsens background-FP images from `7/50` to `11/50`;
  at `conf=0.001` it drops recall from `100/130` to `94/130` with the same
  `50/50` background flood. The lightweight transfer scorecard makes the
  rejection explicit:
  `runs/cashsnap/scorecard_target_anchor_latest_bal20_hsvv07_realtest_bal10_bg50_v1.json`
  fails all three thresholds (`conf=0.05` FP `+14`; `conf=0.01` FP `+57` and
  bg-hit images `+4`; `conf=0.001` recall `-0.0462`, FP `+6`). Next
  curriculum work needs FP-aware tuning or seed-repeat proof, not a direct
  `hsv_v=0.7` promotion.
- Candidate-only `mosaic=0.0` is the strongest current curriculum clue, but
  still not a promotion. Seed 0 improves fixed-step synthetic self-eval
  (`0.011476` vs `0.007368`, delta `+0.004108`, worst `KHR_5000 -0.012462`);
  seed 1 repeats the gain (`0.013898` vs `0.007670`, delta `+0.006228`, worst
  `USD_10 -0.001699`). Bounded real at `conf=0.01` is better-shaped in both
  seeds: seed 0 finds `3/130` GT with fewer FPs/background hits than baseline
  (`188 -> 186` FPs, `7/50 -> 6/50` bg-hit images), and seed 1 preserves
  `2/130` recall while reducing FPs/background hits (`253 -> 163` FPs,
  `12/50 -> 5/50`). The blocker is high-confidence/background safety and
  protected-class swaps: seed 0 adds `28` FPs at `conf=0.05`; seed 1 adds `45`
  FPs and `1` bg-hit image at `conf=0.05`; `conf=0.001` improves aggregate
  recall/FPs but still has per-class recall drops. Turning `erasing=0.0` off on
  top of no-mosaic gives the same self-eval and identical `conf=0.01` bounded
  real result, so erasing is not the current lever. Read: mosaic likely
  contributes to the full-frame/extent failure, but hard zero-mosaic needs a
  partial-mosaic schedule (`0.25`/`0.5`), FP-aware guard, and class guard before
  any recipe change.
- Earlier non-fallback fixed-step A/B attempts remain incomplete:
  b64/b32/b16/b8 runs hit the 95% RAM guard while RunLong/Codex were resident.
  Also, one failed b64 attempt reused the old leader run name with the
  wrapper's real-clean default before this was caught; do not trust that run
  directory's current weights. Use the previously written metrics JSONs as
  historical evidence or rerun clean with explicit `--model yolo26n.pt` under
  lower memory pressure.
- Latest model-side retry: b8 `target_anchor_latest_yolo_b8_s150_ctxprobe_v1`
  trained the baseline from `yolo26n.pt`, but candidate inpaintctx hit the 95%
  RAM guard; b4 and b2/no-AMP retries also hit the guard during setup/scanning.
  A train-only YAML helper avoided scanning the real val split during no-val
  setup, but b8 inpaintctx still hit the RAM guard mid-epoch and wrote no
  weights. No fair model A/B exists for inpaintctx/couplectx yet in this
  RunLong session.
- Do not promote either sourcectx fallback branch. Next best synth-data move is
  to attack the real-transfer failure directly: diagnose the bounded-real false
  positives/full-frame boxes and missing true positives, then add curriculum or
  gating that penalizes background hallucination and improves real note
  localization before spending more time on representation-only source-context
  variants.

Multi-instance replacement diagnostic status:
- `scripts/build_cashsnap_multi_instance_replacement.py` is now the active
  step-change probe for real scene context: it erases all known CashSnap source
  boxes, inserts approved assets into the real geometry slots, writes visible
  YOLO labels plus quad metadata, and supports source filename filters,
  balanced class cycling, tone-reference modes, and Poisson variants.
- Baseline medium Poisson replacement is useful but not trainable:
  `cashsnap_multi_instance_replacement_medium_poisson_probe_v1` passes dataset
  and visual QA, with edge `boundary=1.2286`, `color_step=0.0714`; against
  positive real-train samples the separator is still high
  `image/box/crop AUC=0.790/0.808/0.907`, and crops are too dark/saturated
  (`luma_mean -0.140`, `saturation_mean +0.154`).
- Full original-source tone plus stricter scale improves proxies but exposed a
  false path: `scale120` reached `image/box/crop AUC=0.675/0.759/0.850` and
  crop saturation gap `+0.086`, but its source pool includes stock/catalog
  images and watermarks. Reject that as target-domain context despite the
  prettier numbers.
- Phone-context filtering (`--source-name-require-regex IMG_`) removes the
  stock/watermark shortcut but makes same-class replacement too KHR-heavy and
  too dark/saturated (`crop AUC=0.964` for full real-crop tone). Do not use
  same-source-class phone replacement as a broad trainable root.
- Balanced phone replacement fixes class coverage (`7-8` boxes per class in
  40 images). Strong Poisson gives best edge color step (`0.0699`) but washes
  note interiors and has `crop AUC=0.958`; light Poisson preserves note color
  (`luma_mean -0.083`, `saturation_mean +0.088`) but edge color step explodes
  to `0.1541`; edge-weighted Poisson is the current best direction. The
  no-tiny visible gate variant passes dataset and visual QA with `95` boxes
  balanced across all `13` classes, but still has visible paste boundaries and
  remains separable (`image/box/crop AUC=0.839/0.836/0.928`, edge color step
  `0.1015`).
- Strict real-clean detector audit on that no-tiny branch is not clean but is
  bounded: `1/40` suspect images, `1` unmatched prediction at `conf=0.05`,
  `match_iou=0.1`, `min_prediction_coverage=0.5`
  (`runs/cashsnap/unlabeled_prediction_audit_multi_instance_replacement_context_phone_balanced_poissonedge_inpainttone_scale100_notiny_strictcov50_v1.json`).
  The suspect is a broad low-confidence `KHR_50000` prediction spanning two
  labeled notes, not an obvious erased-source remnant.
- Real-clean representation probe is also bounded but still negative:
  `runs/cashsnap/representation_gap_realclean_multi_instance_phone_balanced_poissonedge_notiny_test_v1/summary.json`
  selected `80` class-balanced rows and reports domain accuracy
  `0.850/0.912/0.887` at layers `0/8/22` (`MMD2` at layer `22` is `0.0853`).
  This is better than older real-clean source Poisson at mid/late layers, but
  still far above a trainable/promotion signal.
- Decision: keep multi-instance replacement as a mechanism branch, not a
  trainable package. Next work should add source-context quality gates and
  improve edge-weighted blending before any detector audit/model proof.
  Detector/source-remnant audits still need RAM headroom.

Success signal is not a prettier sheet. A real step-change branch should reduce
early-layer domain separability, recover broad real positive recall, and avoid
new empty-frame FPs. If domain accuracy stays above about `0.90` at mid/late
layers and real misses stay broad, the branch is still teaching shortcuts.

## Refiner Smoke

Goal: test whether a label-preserving learned/refiner path can remove the
remaining composited-camera shortcut without mutating denomination evidence.

Starting point:
- Use isolated Poisson/contact target-anchor output as the synthetic source.
- Use train-only CashSnap images/crops as target-domain appearance anchors.
- Do not use CashSnap val/test for refiner training, discriminator training, or
  prompt tuning.
- Keep boxes, quads, class ids, and metadata unchanged by design.
- Use `runs/cashsnap/refiner_readiness_poisson_contact_m260_v1/synthetic_manifest.jsonl`
  as the current audit manifest for AI-refiner work unless a stronger source
  distribution replaces isolated Poisson/contact.

Preferred order:
1. Low-denoise SD-Turbo/img2img with hard note+edge recomposition is the current
   local baseline because it passed the 260-image audit gates.
2. Bake off newer controlled editors/inpainters (ICEdit, Qwen-Image-Edit,
   FLUX editing variants, Step1X-Edit, OmniGen2) on the same 20-50 image pack
   before spending larger GPU/API time.
3. Inpainting/background-only variants are preferred over whole-image editing
   because hallucination is harmless only outside the protected note/edge mask.
4. FastCUT/CUT and CycleGAN-Turbo are diagnostic only unless a future patch
   fixes visual quality and 8GB memory pressure.

Smoke stages:
- `20-50` image visual/label smoke.
- `200-500` image audit probe with edge/crop/domain checks.
- `1k+` trainable candidate only after the small probes pass.

Required gates before any refined dataset is trainable:
- Exact label/metadata preservation.
- Full-size visual QA, not just contact sheets. Open several clear,
  full-size/simple-scene images with vision; compressed contact-sheet tiles hide
  rendering flaws and are not enough for visual reasoning.
- Composite-edge audit.
- Crop/geometry audit.
- Real-trained detector consistency on synthetic labels.
- Class-detail spot review for weak/protected classes.
- Domain separator as a warning light.
- Fixed-step `yolo26n` transfer.
- Background-FP guardrail.
- Per-class guard.
- At least one seed repeat before serious promotion.

Immediate next concrete step: keep the refiner harness available, but do not
spend more runs on SD-Turbo prompt/strength tweaks until a candidate reduces the
representation gap or directly attacks the obligation ledger. The current
note-edge SD-Turbo m260 candidate is a harness proof, not a promotion path.

Kill criteria:
- Denomination text, portraits, numerals, colors, or security details mutate.
- Refiner erases small visible class evidence.
- Edges still look pasted after tone improves.
- Domain stats improve but real transfer does not.
- Empty-frame FPs worsen without a compensating real-transfer result strong
  enough to justify a new branch.

## Negative Bank

Realistic near-negatives matter now. The real background-FP review shows
empty-label false positives are often full non-target banknotes or target-like
paper on the same retail surfaces as positives.

Current state:
- Existing WebGL unknown/hard-negative roots are too stylized/easy.
- Hardnegdiv8, realbgneg25, and unknownsoftfp8lowconf did not clear guardrails.
- `configs/synthetic_recipes/cashsnap_external_negative_banks_v1.json` is
  planned/registry work, not an accepted trainable bank.
- Train-split FP-mined real negatives are useful diagnostics. Top-25 is too
  suppressive; spread-8 is the current best pressure shape because it reduces
  giant/background FPs while preserving the tiny real-positive signal. Do not
  treat mined real negatives as the final synthetic pipeline; use them to define
  what realistic synthetic/curated near-negatives must reproduce.
- WebGL full-frame unknown-currency negatives reproduce the big-box geometry
  pressure but not the mined-real transfer balance yet. Current dose-4/8 probes
  reduce full-frame FP counts while losing one or both bounded-real true
  positives. Negative visual-gap audit says the synthetic root is far brighter
  and less color-varied than mined real FPs, so improve exposure/color/texture
  before scaling this axis.
- A dark full-frame WebGL correction now materially closes that audit gap
  without using real mined negatives in training, but tiny dose-1 and dose-4
  fixed-step probes both fail synthetic self-eval. Treat it as an audit
  calibration clue, not a trainable recipe. The next move is to decouple dark
  mined-FP camera statistics from dominant target-like full-frame note
  semantics.
- Soft-dark WebGL negatives successfully decouple full-frame hardness from the
  dark mined-FP visual domain, but dose-1/4 still fail self-eval. That changes
  the active bet: add matched dark positive examples or curriculum/loss controls
  before testing more dark zero-label near-negatives.
- Matched dark positives were tested and rejected too: WebGL dark support
  1/class and 2/class both failed, and a label-preserving dark-style copy from
  trusted alpha/contact positives failed by a similar amount. The lesson is to
  stop treating "dark currency-like pixels" as a row-bank problem. Build a
  mild-to-strong style ladder and/or training augmentation/curriculum gate that
  preserves the alpha/geoscale self-eval first, with `KHR_5000` watched as the
  recurring worst-class canary.
- The first style ladder confirms the row-bank lesson: even mild dark-style
  positive copies fail self-eval. Candidate-only `hsv_v=0.7` passes self-eval
  and gets two low-confidence bounded-real TPs at `conf=0.01`, but it worsens
  background FPs and loses recall at `conf=0.001`. No-mosaic now has seed-repeat
  self-eval proof and useful `conf=0.01` bounded-real shape, but it still fails
  high-confidence/background and per-class guards. Treat augmentation/curriculum
  as the next controllable axis; the next probe should tune mosaic schedule
  before changing trainable recipes.

Next realistic bank should include reviewed foreign/unknown currencies,
target-lookalike partial notes, receipts, cards, patterned paper, and retail
clutter rendered or composited through the same camera-domain policy, paired
with target-positive support under that camera domain so "dark currency-like"
does not mean "background." Do not mine CashSnap val/test empty frames into
training.

## Promotion Gates

A synthetic axis is credible only with:
- Full real val/test improvement or preservation.
- Clean-visible val/test preservation.
- Labeled-positive and geometry-stress preservation.
- Protected-class preservation, especially riel.
- Real empty-frame FP detections and images-with-FP not worse at `conf=0.05`,
  `imgsz=416`, `batch=1`, `device=0`.
- Max per-class mAP50-95 drop `<=0.05` unless explicitly waived.
- At least one seed repeat for serious promotion, more for large claims.

Synthetic package gates are necessary filters, not promotion authority.
For low-memory bounded real probes, run
`scripts/build_yolo_lightweight_transfer_scorecard.py` over the matching
`eval_yolo_lightweight_real_recall.py` baseline/candidate JSONs at multiple
confidence thresholds. Self-eval preservation is not enough; the scorecard must
also show no recall regression and no increase in total/image/background FPs.

Clean-base can move toward overlap/fan/hand only when synthetic-only `yolo26n`
is near the target line, clean-visible and labeled-positive test are `>=0.75`,
protected riel passes, real-empty FPs are no worse than control, and the result
survives at least two seeds or a slow-promotion run.

## Validation Slices

- Full real val/test includes many empty-label images; always pair aggregate AP
  with empty-frame FP probes.
- Roboflow core-13 bridge is the cleaner positive KHR/USD judge for the current
  detector. Pair it with CashSnap empty-frame FP diagnostics; neither replaces
  the other.
- Roboflow official21 partial bridge preserves official classes present in the
  source, including `KHR_100`, but is not evaluable with current 13-class
  weights.
- `runs/cashsnap/real_geometry_stress_slices_v1` is the current provisional real
  geometry slice set.
- `labeled_all`: positive-only val/test, `988/814` images.
- `geometry_stress`: broad non-clean labeled val/test, `791/659` images.
- True `multi_note` is only `2/3` images and is not fan/overlap proof.
- Protected-riel slices are small; use scoped checks and do not over-read one
  noisy class row.
- Curated real fan/overlap benchmark status:
  `scripts/check_real_fan_benchmark.py` passes, but only
  `real_overlap_0003_commons_shop_5k_10k_20k` is labeled (`6` boxes);
  the harder fan and perspective multi-note candidates still need human labels.
- Mined-real diagnostic stress status:
  `scripts/check_mined_real_review_quality.py` reports `17` ready stress images
  and `35` scoreable boxes; `scripts/build_mined_real_scoreable_dataset.py`
  materializes `runs/cashsnap/mined_real_scoreable_dataset_latest/data.yaml`,
  and `check_yolo_dataset.py` passes on it. Coverage is useful but narrow:
  dense overlap `3`, fan `2`, thin edge `6`, weak class `6`; classes are
  `KHR_500/KHR_1000/KHR_5000/KHR_20000/KHR_50000/USD_20` only.
- Lightweight eval on the mined-real stress data is wired but currently
  RAM-blocked: the headroom wrapper killed the first `320/b1` eval at the `95%`
  RAM guard before writing metrics. Rerun when available RAM is above the guard.
- Own-photo capture bridge is empty. `scripts/check_capture_requirements.py`
  reports `0` inventory rows, `0` usable rows, and all `16` requirements
  missing; the inbox guides already exist under
  `data/inbox/real_partial_photos/`. Highest P1 gaps are hand fan,
  same-denomination fan, KHR_5000/KHR_20000 thin slices, KHR_5000 face+number
  overlap, KHR_50000 hard positives, mixed USD+KHR stack, no-note backgrounds,
  and non-banknote paper props.
- Mission readiness remains false: `10` required conditions, `9` with active
  suite packages, real role coverage `1/5`, candidate hints `5/7`, and usable
  captures `0`. The mixed rare/common USD+KHR stack now has a rendered
  diagnostic root,
  `data/synthetic/cashsnap_webgl_mixed_rare_common_cross_currency_stack_diagnostic_v1/`,
  with `12` balanced images and `54` boxes (`9` each for
  `USD_50/USD_20/KHR_1000/KHR_5000/KHR_20000/KHR_50000`); dataset, label-view,
  class-distribution, and note-print-tone gates pass. Do not add it to the
  trainable suite until real mixed USD+KHR rare/common captures exist.

## Label And Class Policy

- Detector labels are visible-instance AABBs derived from the renderer/CV
  visible mask or source annotation, one box per visible class instance.
- OBB/quadrilateral metadata preserves side/pose information for audits and
  future oriented/fusion work; it is not a direct YOLO detect label today.
- Fragment/evidence labels are for disconnected visible evidence and future
  count fusion. They are not direct physical-note count labels.
- Zero-label hard-negative roots must remain zero-label. Do not silently turn
  unknown/foreign note props into target classes.
- Raw Roboflow exports are intake. Use bridge builders to convert them into
  schema-aware processed roots.
- `KHR_100` is official KHR, not garbage. It is excluded only from the current
  core-13 bridge because the active detector cannot predict it yet.
- Current active detector scope is 13 operational classes, not all official
  KHR/USD. Official current scope is 21 classes.
- `KHR_50` remains blocked for v1 operational training unless real retail/bank
  capture evidence or an explicit product requirement justifies it.
- Trainable WebGL target-note renders must pass
  `scripts/check_webgl_texture_asset_policy.py` against the approved texture
  bank. USD_20 must remain the reviewed `2004-2021` current design.

Script notes:
- `build_webgl_hard_negative_dose_config.py` accepts directory train splits as
  well as `.txt` lists and supports `--filename-contains`,
  `--intended-use`, and `--promotion-rule`.
- `build_fp_mined_negative_dose_config.py` accepts directory train splits as
  well as `.txt` lists and supports `--selection top|spread|random` for
  negative-dose shape probes.
- WebGL `--negative-prop-policy unknown_currency_fullframe_v1` is diagnostic
  only: it creates dominant zero-label unknown-banknote props for full-frame FP
  pressure and is registered as `webgl_unknown_currency_fullframe_negative_v1`.
- WebGL `--negative-prop-policy unknown_currency_fullframe_dark_v1` plus
  `--camera-isp-policy mined_fp_dark_v1` is the teacher-aligned dark correction
  recipe `webgl_unknown_currency_fullframe_dark_negative_v1`; it matches mined
  FP visual stats much better but fails dose-1/4 fixed-step self-eval, so use it
  as a teacher for softer dark near-negatives rather than as a scaled recipe.
- WebGL `--negative-prop-policy unknown_currency_soft_dark_v1` keeps soft
  unknown-currency hardness while using mined-FP dark surfaces/palettes. It
  passes negative diversity and visual-gap audit, but dose-1/4 fixed-step
  self-eval still fails; pair with dark target-positive support before any
  further negative-only dose.
- `audit_negative_fp_visual_gap.py` compares mined real background-FP review
  manifests with synthetic negative roots using image/crop visual stats; use it
  before spending GPU on a new zero-label negative recipe.
- `build_cashsnap_target_anchor_transplant.py` accepts
  `--geometry-manifest` with `--geometry-manifest-mode prefer|only`; `prefer`
  uses train-anchor geometry where present and falls back per missing class.
- `build_cashsnap_target_anchor_transplant.py` also accepts
  `--couple-background-geometry`, `--geometry-size-jitter`,
  `--position-jitter-fraction`, and `--warp-alpha-feather-px` for train-anchor
  inpaint/context diagnostics.
- `build_cashsnap_multi_instance_replacement.py` must remain diagnostic until
  source-remnant/model proof exists. For phone-context probes, prefer explicit
  `--source-name-require-regex IMG_` and balanced replacement; stock/catalog
  sources can improve proxy metrics while being the wrong target domain.
- `build_cashsnap_target_anchor_transplant.py` can use train-positive source
  images via `--background-manifest`, dynamic erase via
  `--inpaint-under-foreground-px`, and source-box erase via
  `--inpaint-source-box-pad-fraction`; these modes are mechanism probes until
  visual label-safety is proven.
- `build_yolo_inpainted_background_bank.py` creates train-only empty-label
  inpainted canvases from labeled YOLO images; use `--max-mask-fraction` to
  reject full-frame erasures that make obvious scars.
- `materialize_yolo_trainonly_data_yaml.py` rewrites `val`/`test` to `train`
  for no-val training setup only. Evaluate with the original data YAML; do not
  treat train-only YAML metrics as real transfer.

## Repo And Harness Rules

- RunLong mode: prefix terminal commands with `rl`.
- Work directly on `master` unless asked for a branch.
- Repo-local runtime storage is enforced through `scripts/local_runtime.py`.
- YOLO promotion posture: `batch=64`, `workers=0`, `device=0`, `cache=false`;
  eval `batch=64`, `workers=2`.
- Background-FP guardrail uses `batch=1`.
- In RunLong/Codex memory pressure, use quiet/log-redirection and b8/b16
  diagnostics. Do not compare lower-batch diagnostics to b64 promotion parity
  without saying so.
- Long refiner training/inference must run through `scripts/run_with_headroom.py`
  unless there is a specific reason not to. The wrapper enforces the repo's
  95% CPU/RAM/GPU-memory ceiling and keeps the machine usable.
- WebGL posture: `--render-jobs 2 --renderer-batch-size 32 --check-jobs 4`.
- `cache=disk` is rejected; it created many `.npy` files, used about 12 GB, and
  slowed throughput.
- Active docs are `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and this file.
- Old working memory belongs in `docs/archive/`.
- Generated synthetic roots stay under ignored `data/synthetic/`.
- External negatives stay under ignored `data/external_negatives/`.
- Training/eval outputs stay under ignored `runs/`.
- Browser/temp/cache state stays under ignored `.cache_runtime/` or `tmp/`.
