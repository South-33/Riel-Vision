# CashSnap Model Brain

This is the one living document for model work. If the plan changes, update this file first. Keep it clean, current, and useful for the next agent dropped into the repo.

## Mission

Build a small phone/browser-deployable model that counts mixed USD and Khmer Riel from one casual retail photo. The hard requirement is partial-note recognition: half, quarter, thin edge, overlapped, fanned, and hand-occluded notes must still be identified when humans can see enough denomination evidence.

Counterfeit detection is out of scope.

## Current North Star

Active bet: make synthetic data generation good enough to be the scaling unit, but judge it only by real partial/fan transfer.

Current phase: WebGL synthetic generation is mechanically auditable, but full-real all-target training seeds are rejected. The full-real real-only control also collapses, so the immediate failure is the all-target/background-heavy curriculum and rare-class exposure shape, not accepted WebGL texture by itself. Capped real-only probes recover much of the all-target loss but are not promotable yet: p48/bg48 tests at `0.833190`, p48/bg48 with rare duplicate oversampling at `0.832952`, p96/bg96 at `0.819153`, versus the p24 real-only gate at `0.835861` and the clean checkpoint at `0.883801`. The synthetic factory is good enough to run controlled experiments; the training mix/curriculum is not yet safe enough to scale into the actual model build.

Current model direction after split-label QA: keep the lightweight detector path for clean/mostly-visible notes, add a fragment/evidence detector or classifier path for partial OCR/denomination cues, then fuse fragments into physical-note counts. Do not treat OBB as the primary hard-fan solution; use OBB only for compact visible instances where the rotated box is honest.

Training-smoke results prove the harness, not model quality. The renderer/package contract now exists; the missing evidence is scoreable real fan/overlap stress labels for P1 transfer proof.

Latest model comparison: the old 621-image accepted-WebGL blend remains rejected (`0.810` held-out clean test mAP50-95 vs `0.884` clean checkpoint). A stricter 445-image blend of individually accepted WebGL recipes passes the matched real-only clean-test gate (`0.836855` vs `0.835861`, delta `+0.000994`), but fails the per-class guard on `KHR_2000` (`-0.052433`). Full all-target seeds regress badly: uncapped accepted synthetic tests at `0.807251` vs `0.883801` clean checkpoint (delta `-0.076550`), capped accepted synthetic tests at `0.785412` (delta `-0.098389`), and full-real real-only tests at `0.783482` (delta `-0.100319`). Real-only p48/bg48 improves over the full-real all-target control by `+0.049708` but still misses the p24 real-only gate by `-0.002671`; duplicating rare selected images to 48 appearances also misses (`0.832952`, `-0.002909` vs p24) and damages `KHR_50000` versus plain p48 (`-0.110185`). Treat the accepted blend as ablation evidence only; fix rare-aware real curriculum before any scale target.

2.5D remains useful as a matched baseline and fallback, but WebGL synthetic is the main candidate path.

Label policy: exact visible masks/ID colors are authoritative. Detect AABBs are compatibility labels for detect-only probes; OBB labels are useful only when the visible mask is compact enough that a rotated rectangle does not cover large hidden regions. Fragment labels mean visible connected evidence components, not physical bill counts. If one physical bill is visible as disconnected islands, keep it one counted instance in mask metadata, skip/flag unsafe OBB, and use fragment labels plus downstream fusion rather than projecting a hidden-paper box. Barely visible fragments should get a denomination label only when a human can identify the denomination from visible evidence; otherwise use ignore/unknown instead of forcing a guess.

## Promising Next Moves

The best-supported path right now is a scoreable P1 transfer test:

1. Promote or capture rights-clean real fan/overlap stress labels, especially `KHR_5000` face+number overlaps and `KHR_20000` thin/edge backs.
2. Repair the real curriculum before more synthetic scale: keep p24/p48-style caps, but do not rely on duplicate-only rare oversampling. The next useful probe should add genuine rare-denom variation through curated real examples, weighted loss/sampling, or synthetic rare-heavy fan/occlusion scenes, and any expanded real-only control must beat the p24 gate without eroding `KHR_50000`. Keep `configs/cashsnap_v1_plus_webgl_accepted_nowarmup_probe.yaml` as bounded ablation evidence only.
3. Probe fragment-to-physical-note fusion once the evaluation set can expose whether fragment evidence helps or just overcounts.
4. Promote synthetic changes when they improve the real scoreboard without materially regressing clean/base validation or browser deploy guards.

Current evidence gap: P1 transfer has 0 promoted real fan/overlap stress labels. Public/raw candidates are useful diagnostics, but not scoreable substitutes.

## Synthetic Pipeline State

Goal: make synthetic data a controlled experiment generator, not just an image generator. A future failure should map to a missing condition, label issue, domain gap, training mix, or fusion bug instead of "we need better data."

Done and trusted:

- Real-target matrix and WebGL recipe catalog map required conditions, promotion gates, and blockers.
- Numista in-circulation cutout bank is the canonical clean asset source for now.
- WebGL packages separate physical parents from visible fragments, export exact ID masks, visible-only detect labels, guarded OBB labels, fragment labels, ignored-fragment metadata, preview overlays, contact indexes, quarantine metadata, and deterministic QA hashes.
- Smoke/trainable-candidate gates cover visual rejects, layer violations, selected train views, unsafe OBB exclusions, review-required fragments, and blank/exposure failures.
- WebGL generic clean/stack/fan recipes support `--class-sequence` for targeted weak-denomination smoke/dose tests; `webgl_rare_class_support_v1` has a balanced 16-image rare-KHR distribution audit, but still needs real rare-class validation before trainable-candidate approval.
- The first bounded WebGL trainable-candidate suite is refreshed at 1440x1080 with `visual_scale: 1`, visually accepted, and train-smoke proven under headroom. Its active mix validates as 304 images / 1160 boxes; rejected probes stay cataloged but out of `cashsnap_webgl_trainable_candidates_v1`.
- Recipe-isolated WebGL ablation configs now exist under `configs/webgl_ablation/` with train lists under `configs/generated_lists/webgl_ablation/`; use these before scaling blended synthetic again.
- `compare_yolo_metrics.py --max-per-class-drop` now turns hidden denomination regressions into comparison failures; `run_webgl_recipe_ablation.py` passes a `0.05` per-class guard by default and summarizes worst-class deltas/failure counts. Accepted-blend selection keeps global mAP failure reasons separate from per-class drop failures and preserves the post-train blend gate when the selected recipe set is unchanged.
- `check_webgl_class_distribution.py` gates targeted WebGL dose packages from `counts/summary.json`, so class-sequence probes can fail automatically on class leakage, missing expected classes, or excessive class imbalance.
- `check_webgl_count_stress.py` gates per-image count stress from `counts/targets.jsonl`, including same-class repeat images, max same-class count, split-parent counts, and fragment-overcount pressure.
- `configs/cashsnap_v1_plus_webgl_accepted_nowarmup_probe.yaml` is the current bounded accepted-blend ablation: global clean-test transfer passes matched real-only by `+0.000994` mAP50-95, but its `KHR_2000` per-class drop blocks blind scale.
- `scripts/build_yolo_balanced_subset.py --always-max-per-class` can cap labeled always-included synthetic dose per class; this is useful tooling, but the capped full-real accepted seed is also rejected and should not be promoted.
- `configs/cashsnap_v1_full_real_only_seed.yaml` proves the all-target real curriculum is itself unsafe: 1 epoch from the clean checkpoint tests at `0.783482` mAP50-95 vs `0.883801` clean checkpoint, nearly identical to the capped accepted-synthetic failure.
- `configs/cashsnap_v1_real_only_p48_bg48_seed.yaml`, `configs/cashsnap_v1_real_only_p48_bg48_rare48_seed.yaml`, and `configs/cashsnap_v1_real_only_p96_bg96_seed.yaml` prove capped real-only expansion is safer than full all-target but still not enough: p48/bg48 tests at `0.833190`, duplicate rare p48/bg48/rare48 at `0.832952`, and p96/bg96 at `0.819153`, while the p24 real-only gate remains `0.835861`.

Still missing:

- Scoreable real fan/overlap labels for P1 transfer.
- Scoreable real repeated-denomination fan labels for same-class counting/fusion transfer.
- Real-derived camera/postprocess profiles from CashSnap captures and EXIF.
- A fragment-to-physical-note fusion path for real inference.
- Accepted trainable real background banks.
- A `KHR_2000`/`KHR_50000`-safe accepted blend or a justified per-class tolerance for rare-class test variance.
- A promotable real-only curriculum expansion that beats the p24 gate while preserving rare `KHR_50000`/`KHR_20000` transfer.
- End-to-end promotion rules that combine real-scoreboard improvement, clean-validation/test guardrails, per-class metric guardrails, browser/deploy guardrails, and enough metadata to diagnose regressions.

## Operating Principle

Use this file as context, not a cage. Any agent should pursue the path that best advances reliable CashSnap counting, including changing harnesses, configs, scripts, or strategy when the current setup slows the goal or encodes a bad assumption.

Update this file only when something becomes durable working memory: a decision, a trusted/rejected data source, a result that changes what to run next, or a cleanup rule that prevents future wasted effort. Do not record every passing command or scratch experiment.

## Practical Constraints

This is a laptop workflow, so keep heavy CPU/RAM/GPU work behind a headroom wrapper when practical. If the wrapper or a harness gets in the way of a better experiment, improve the harness instead of treating it as doctrine.

Default repo posture: work on `master`/mainline, keep generated YOLO/training outputs under repo-local ignored `runs/`, and treat `results.tsv` only as deprecated scratch rather than project memory.

## Local Machine Profile

- Machine: Lenovo 82Y9 laptop.
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 7640HS, 6 cores / 12 logical processors, 4.3 GHz reported max clock.
- RAM: about 16 GB physical memory.
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU, 8 GB VRAM, driver 596.21.
- Re-scan command: `rl python scripts\profile_system.py --out .cache_runtime\system_profile.json`.
- Current operating rule: laptop usability matters. Heavy jobs should prefer 90% max CPU/RAM/GPU/VRAM caps, resume around 82%, and never set caps above 95%.
- If this hardware is unexpectedly slow, suspect RAM pressure first, then laptop GPU power/thermal limits, then data-loader worker count.
- `scripts/run_with_headroom.py` now refuses caps above 95%, lowers child priority, and waits for initial headroom before launching a heavy child. The free-RAM floor is a preflight gate and runtime warning; after launch, hard pauses/exits follow the explicit RAM/VRAM max caps so pause-sensitive browser jobs do not trip wall-clock timeouts.
- `scripts/bench_train_with_headroom.py` dry-run currently selects `batch=2`, `workers=0` on this laptop and passes `--min-free-ram-gb 4.0` to the live wrapper.
- Balance speed and headroom. Prefer GPU for training/inference when it is the faster engine and has room, but do not force GPU for CPU-native prep/rendering if the headroom wrapper keeps the laptop responsive.

## Command Posture

Do not let this file become a command catalog. Keep only the few commands that express the current model decision; script discovery and older workflows belong in the code, CLI help, or archived notes.

Current useful checks:

- P1 readiness: `rl python scripts\check_webgl_p1_readiness.py --smoke-mix configs\cashsnap_webgl_trainable_candidates_mix.yaml`
- Trainable-candidate dry run: `rl python scripts\run_webgl_trainable_candidate_pipeline.py --dry-run --train-smoke`
- Targeted class-dose gate: `rl python scripts\check_webgl_class_distribution.py --root <webgl_root> --expected-classes '<CSV>' --min-images <n> --min-per-class <n> --max-class-spread <n>`
- Count-stress gate: `rl python scripts\check_webgl_count_stress.py --root <webgl_root> --min-repeat-images <n> --min-max-same-class <n>`
- Real benchmark boundary: `rl python scripts\check_real_fan_benchmark.py`
- Capture gaps: `rl python scripts\check_capture_requirements.py`
- Training wrapper dry run: `rl python scripts\bench_train_with_headroom.py --data configs\cashsnap_v1.yaml --name dry_run --dry-run --quiet`

If a different path is more promising, use or improve the relevant script instead of preserving this list.

## Result Ledger

Keep this table curated. Add rows only for results that change what a future agent should trust, avoid, or run next. Do not add a row for a passing command unless it changes a decision.

| Date Local | Area | Status | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-05-30 | renderer | keep | P0/P1 renderer proofs are deterministic enough for experiments: RGB/ID passes, visible-only labels, metadata, OBB sidecars, and YOLO dataset checks all pass under headroom. |
| 2026-05-30 | labels | keep | Split-label QA proves the counting risk: `qa3` has 3 physical notes vs 5 fragments, and full-schema fan smoke has 67 physical visible instances vs 120 fragments. Fragment evidence must be fused back to physical parents before count totals; OBB is only honest for compact visible masks. |
| 2026-05-30 | data | keep | Numista cutout bank is the canonical clean asset source for now: 76 assets with full 13-class front/back coverage. It remains internal/reference until usage review is complete, and the audit still flags 3 red-mark visual suspects. |
| 2026-05-30 | targets | keep | `cashsnap_real_target_matrix_v1` and the WebGL recipe catalog map real target conditions to synthetic recipe slots, promotion gates, and blockers; use `check_synthetic_recipe_catalog.py` before changing coverage. |
| 2026-05-30 | packaging | keep | WebGL packages are auditable: `qa/summary.json`, `recipe.json`, preview overlays, visual+ID mask overlays, `qa/quarantine.json`, `qa/contact_index.json`, deterministic hashes, and label-view QA are all part of the contract. |
| 2026-05-30 | smoke | keep | Smoke-ready WebGL modes are clean, stack, fan, negative, thin-edge, and hand-occlusion. The refreshed gated smoke mix is diagnostic-only (19 images / 67 boxes), not a training-performance claim. |
| 2026-05-31 | evaluation | blocked | `real_overlap_0003_commons_shop_5k_10k_20k` is promoted as a 6-box visible-denomination/mild-overlap sanity label by Codex visual audit. P1 transfer is still blocked by 0 promoted real fan/overlap stress labels. |
| 2026-05-31 | training | note | The smoke tiny train is only a harness proof: after YAML root normalization, 1 epoch under headroom completed with diagnostic mAP50-95 around `0.002`. Do not read it as model quality. |
| 2026-05-31 | training | note | The 304-image WebGL trainable-candidate mix runs through YOLO training under headroom. Batch 2 hit the 90% RAM cap, the wrapper relaunched at batch 1/pause-resume, and the diagnostic 1-epoch smoke ended around mAP50-95 `0.000385`; this is trainability evidence only. |
| 2026-05-31 | gates | keep | Trainable-candidate gates pass for all 7 roots after the 1440x1080 `visual_scale: 1` refresh; the gated mix validates as 304 images / 1160 boxes, package QA verifies physical count targets separately from fragment evidence, and the sampled 84-row visual audit pack is accepted. Full P1 remains blocked by 0 promoted real stress labels. |
| 2026-05-31 | policy | keep | Current trainable policy includes deterministic visual QA, fragment review/ignore metadata, geometric transform guards, explicit asset-side policy, explicit phone camera profiles, and background-bank review gates. No trainable background bank is accepted yet. |
| 2026-05-31 | backgrounds | reject | Existing extracted no-note background banks are rejected by Codex contact-sheet audit; a stricter reject-model probe yielded only two crops and one was outdoor/cushion context, so do not retry that path blindly without curated table-source photos. |
| 2026-05-31 | rendering | adjust | Full-suite refresh at 1440x1080 hit the 3 GB free-RAM launch gate during supersampled WebGL renders; trainable-candidate defaults now use `visual_scale: 1` to keep output resolution while avoiding high system-RAM canvas overhead on the laptop. |
| 2026-05-31 | operations | keep | Headless Edge is already GPU-backed on this laptop (`ANGLE` on RTX 4060/D3D11). Suite rows own `visual_scale`; global `--visual-scale` is only an explicit override. Hard-negative mode uses primitive non-banknote props so zero-box frames are not blank tables. |
| 2026-05-31 | real data | blocked | Existing real/raw stress candidates do not unblock P1: `real_fan_0001_voa_commons` is too ambiguous to promote from model hints, `real_overlap_0002_commons_museum` is not a fan/dense-overlap stress substitute, and `data/review/roboflow_cuurecy_detection_is_multinote_probe_v1/contact_sheet.jpg` shows useful Roboflow hand/fan stress references but not scoreable labels because of public/reproduction/split and visible-region policy caveats. Next unblocker is rights-clean phone fan/overlap capture(s) or human-audited stress labels. |

| 2026-06-04 | training | reject | Do not promote the blended accepted-WebGL fine-tunes (`webgl_candidate_balanced_probe_from_clean_e2_i416_noamp`, `webgl_candidate_balanced_low_lr_from_clean_e1_i416_noamp_v2`): the 621-image balanced real+accepted-WebGL subset trained cleanly and produced val mAP50-95 around `0.807`, but held-out clean test was `0.810` versus `0.884` for the prior clean checkpoint on the same split (`compare_yolo_metrics.py` delta `-0.073706`). Synthetic training must pass baseline comparison gates before scaling. |
| 2026-06-04 | evaluation | keep | `val_yolo.py --metrics-json` plus `compare_yolo_metrics.py` is the active comparison path for candidate checkpoints; use JSON all/per-class metrics and max-drop/min-delta/per-class-drop gates instead of scraping terminal logs. |
| 2026-06-04 | operations | note | Laptop RAM headroom is enough after foreground cleanup, but Ultralytics `optimizer=auto` can ignore requested `lr0` (it selected AdamW around `0.000588` despite `--lr0 0.00025`). For true low-LR probes, pass an explicit optimizer such as `--optimizer AdamW`; still gate by held-out JSON comparison. |
| 2026-06-04 | pipeline | keep | `build_webgl_recipe_ablation_configs.py` writes one balanced real-only config plus one balanced real+single-WebGL-recipe config per trainable recipe; all 8 generated YAMLs passed `check_yolo_dataset.py`, and the fan ablation config reached YOLO training end-to-end under headroom. Use recipe ablations before another blended synthetic run. |
| 2026-06-04 | smoke | note | `--max-train-batches` sets Ultralytics `trainer.stop`, which still triggers validation and final eval even when `--no-val` is passed. For cheap train-path smoke, prefer tiny list-backed smoke YAMLs over early-stopping a full-val config. |
| 2026-06-04 | synthetic | reject | `webgl_clean_closeup_v1` and `webgl_clean_closeup_v2` both failed strict matched real-only ablations despite valid labels. V1 scored `0.823222` mAP50-95 vs real-only `0.835861` (delta `-0.012639`); v2 improved global geometry but scored `0.821181` (delta `-0.014680`), worst on `KHR_2000`/`KHR_50000`. They are `rejected_probe` catalog entries and must stay out of active trainable mixes until background/geometry repair changes the evidence. |
| 2026-06-04 | synthetic | provisional | The 445-image accepted blend (`clean_base`, `thin_edge`, `hard_negative`, `back_side`) is the best current scale seed: held-out clean test `0.836855` vs matched real-only `0.835861` (delta `+0.000994`). It fails the per-class guard on `KHR_2000` (`-0.052433`, threshold `-0.05`), so scale only with `KHR_2000`/`KHR_50000` watch metrics or staged dose tests. |
| 2026-06-04 | synthetic | reject | The 413-image no-thin-edge core blend is not safer: held-out clean test `0.832365` vs real-only `0.835861` (delta `-0.003496`), with worse `KHR_50000` (`-0.059880`) and `KHR_2000` (`-0.050304`) deltas. Do not prefer it over the full accepted blend. |
| 2026-06-04 | training | reject | Full clean-real + uncapped accepted synthetic is a hard reject. The 5-epoch low-LR/no-AMP seed had best val mAP50-95 at epoch 1 (`0.84559`), but held-out clean test was `0.807251` vs `0.883801` clean checkpoint (delta `-0.076550`), with rare-class collapse on `KHR_50000` (`-0.587183`) and `KHR_20000` (`-0.176160`). Do not promote. |
| 2026-06-04 | training | reject | Capping accepted synthetic with `--always-max-per-class 4` does not fix the full-real seed. The 1-epoch capped probe tested at `0.785412` vs `0.883801` clean checkpoint (delta `-0.098389`), with `KHR_50000` (`-0.690631`) and `KHR_20000` (`-0.296286`) worse. The cap is useful sampler tooling, but the next step is isolating full-real real-only/background-heavy curriculum before more synthetic scale. |
| 2026-06-04 | training | reject | Full clean-real real-only all-target seed is also a hard reject. The 1-epoch low-LR/no-AMP control validates at `0.83542`, but held-out clean test is `0.783482` vs `0.883801` clean checkpoint (delta `-0.100319`) and `-0.001930` below the capped accepted-synthetic seed. This implicates the all-target/background-heavy real curriculum and rare-class exposure shape as the primary collapse; do not use full-real all-target seeds until the real-only curriculum is repaired. |
| 2026-06-05 | training | reject | Real-only p96/bg96 is safer than full all-target but not promotable. The 1181-image 1-epoch low-LR/no-AMP control validates at `0.82894` and tests at `0.819153`: `+0.035671` over the full-real all-target reject, but `-0.064648` vs clean and `-0.016708` vs the p24 real-only gate. `KHR_50000` remains the main damage (`0.485681` mAP50-95, `-0.429641` vs clean). |
| 2026-06-05 | training | reject | Real-only p48/bg48 is the best expanded real-only control so far but still misses promotion. The 605-image 1-epoch low-LR/no-AMP control validates at `0.80733` and tests at `0.833190`: `+0.049708` over the full-real all-target reject and `+0.014037` over p96, but `-0.050611` vs clean and `-0.002671` vs the p24 real-only gate. Next repair is richer rare variation or weighting, not larger common-class/background caps. |
| 2026-06-05 | training | reject | Duplicate-only rare oversampling does not promote p48/bg48. `configs/cashsnap_v1_real_only_p48_bg48_rare48_seed.yaml` repeats selected rare images until every class has at least 48 train-list appearances (`+67` duplicates, triggered only by `KHR_20000`/`KHR_50000`), validates at `0.82772`, and tests at `0.832952`: `-0.000237` vs plain p48 and `-0.002909` vs the p24 gate. It helps several classes but drops `KHR_50000` by `-0.110185` vs plain p48, so duplicate exposure alone is rejected; use richer rare variation or weighting next. |
| 2026-06-05 | evaluation | keep | Global-only comparison is now hardened with opt-in per-class guardrails. `compare_yolo_metrics.py --max-per-class-drop 0.05` correctly fails the accepted blend despite global `+0.000994` vs real-only, flagging `KHR_2000` at `-0.052433`; `run_webgl_recipe_ablation.py` applies this guard by default and records worst-class/failure counts in summaries. `build_webgl_accepted_blend_config.py --dry-run` still selects the same four accepted recipes, while rejected reasons now distinguish global mAP failures from per-class drop failures. |
| 2026-06-05 | synthetic | keep | Generic WebGL clean/stack/fan paths now accept a `--class-sequence` override, threaded through `render_webgl_variant_batch.py`, `run_webgl_recipe.py`, suite runners, mix metadata, and recipe metadata. A tiny `webgl_rare_class_support_v1` fan smoke rendered and passed checks: direct 2-image pack had 11 boxes only in `KHR_2000`/`KHR_50000`/`KHR_20000`/`KHR_10000`/`KHR_5000`, and catalog-driven 1-image pack had one box per requested class plus valid label views. Use this for rare-denom diagnostic dose tests, not blind scale. |
| 2026-06-05 | synthetic | keep | `webgl_rare_class_support_v1` class-sequence distribution audit passed on 16 fan images: 86 physical visible targets only in the intended rare/support KHR classes (`KHR_2000`: 18, `KHR_50000`: 18, `KHR_20000`: 17, `KHR_10000`: 17, `KHR_5000`: 16). Label-view QA passed with 132 kept fragments and all 16 OBB views rejected as unsafe, which is correct for heavily fragmented fan masks. This proves targeted rare-KHR dose generation, not real-transfer safety. |
| 2026-06-05 | synthetic | keep | `webgl_fan_fullschema_v1` has strong fan/fragment pressure but no same-denomination repeats (`max_same_class_per_image=1` across 64 images). Added `webgl_same_class_repeat_fan_v1` plus `check_webgl_count_stress.py`; its 12-image diagnostic audit passed with 66 physical targets, 95 kept fragments, all 12 images containing same-class repeats, max same-class count 3, tight targeted class balance (`KHR_5000`: 15, others: 17), and parent-fused all-fragment counts matching physical targets. Keep diagnostic until real repeat-fan validation. |

## Trainable Candidate Artifacts

Generated artifacts live under ignored `data/synthetic/` roots and should not be committed unless explicitly requested. Update this table only when a candidate root becomes trusted, rejected, or its intended train view changes.

| Recipe | Root | Train views | Gate status | Use / caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `webgl_clean_base_v1` | `data/synthetic/cashsnap_webgl_clean_base_candidate_v1` | detect, fragment, OBB | Passed: 32 accepted images, 65 detect/fragment boxes, 32/32 trainable OBB images, 0 visual rejects, `phone_auto` spread across all 4 named profiles. | Clean synthetic baseline candidate. |

## Current Active Assets

Treat this as the durable `data/` map. Named generated outputs may be kept when they support a live result; otherwise prefer regeneration from configs/scripts over keeping stale folders around.

### Tier 0: Canonical Backbone

- `data/numista_raw/`: trusted raw scan metadata/source cache. Numista `in_circulation` is the best scan backbone in this repo.
- `data/asset_candidates/numista_current_cutout_bank_v1/`: current best scan cutout bank. It has a manifest, masks, classes, and front/back metadata.
- `configs/3d_pipeline/proof_p0_renderer_smoke.json`: active renderer smoke config.
- `configs/3d_pipeline/proof_p1_transfer.json`: active transfer-proof config.

### Tier 1: Required Evaluation And Guardrails

- `data/cashsnap_v1/`: verified clean/base YOLO dataset, 13 bill classes and 9,048 labeled boxes. Use it for validation, guardrails, diagnostics, and baseline runs; it is not evidence that hard fan/overlap counting is solved.
- `data/real_fan_benchmark/`: scoreable/stress evaluation only. Never train on it.
- `manifests/real_fan_benchmark_label_quality.csv`: decides which real labels are scoreable.
- `runs/cashsnap/yolo26n_cashsnap_current_thin_legacy_clean_v1_e20_i416_b8/weights/best.pt`: current overlap-counting alpha checkpoint for diagnostics/export, not a solved final model.

### Tier 2: Useful But Conditional

- `data/raw_datasets/roboflow_cuurecy_detection_is/`: useful real phone partial/overlap material; `data/review/roboflow_cuurecy_detection_is_multinote_probe_v1/contact_sheet.jpg` samples dense hand/fan references, but public/reproduction, split, and visible-region label-policy caveats mean it stays review/domain-stress data until curated.
- `data/review/`: keep reviewed or actively reviewed packs; they are more valuable than unreviewed generated classifier datasets.
- `data/backgrounds/`: use only after contact-sheet QA proves no note fragments leaked into backgrounds.
- `data/asset_candidates/*picwish*`: cutout candidates only; hand/skin contamination has repeatedly hurt transfer.

### Tier 3: Archive Or Regenerate

- `data/synthetic/`: generated experiments. Keep only named artifacts referenced by a live result; otherwise regenerate from configs/scripts.
- `data/fragment_classifier*/`: generated classifier datasets/results. Keep only if tied to a live reviewed-data path.
- `data/audit/`, `data/diagnostics/`, `data/sampled/`, `data/processed/`, `data/dedup/`, `tmp/`: scratch/diagnostic areas. Clean aggressively when they are not tied to an active result.
- `data/deprecated/`: delete unless a specific file is promoted back into Tier 1 or Tier 2.

## Data Ranking

1. Numista in-circulation scans: best canonical design and side metadata.
2. Rights-clear Cambodian phone captures: best real transfer evidence once reviewed.
3. Curated real benchmark labels: best evaluation ruler, never training material.
4. Reviewed Roboflow/public partial crops: useful diagnostic supplements, not final proof.
5. NBC/reference/current cutouts: useful for coverage but specimen/old/current scope must be audited.
6. PicWish/BEN2 cutouts: useful only after visual QA and hand/skin filtering.
7. Broad synthetic/probe outputs: disposable unless the result is promoted in this file.

## Config Ranking

Keep visible in `configs/`:

- `cashsnap_v1.yaml`: clean/base YOLO dataset.
- `cashsnap_two_stage_oldcommon_browser_stack.json`: current browser diagnostic stack.
- `3d_pipeline/`: active renderer proof configs.

Everything else belongs under `configs/archive/` unless it is promoted back to active. Old configs are not deleted because they explain prior results, but they should not clutter the first view.

## Script Ranking

Use these first:

- Harness and safety: `run_with_headroom.py`, `bench_train_with_headroom.py`, `local_runtime.py`.
- 3D/synthetic proof: `render_3d_pipeline_probe.py`, `validate_3d_pipeline_config.py`, `build_numista_cutout_bank.py`, `generate_synthetic_fan_dataset.py`, `summarize_synthetic_metadata.py`, `check_yolo_dataset.py`.
- WebGL proof: `renderers/webgl/src/render-smoke.mjs` uses Three.js + `puppeteer-core` against local Microsoft Edge; `run_webgl_recipe.py` resolves named recipe ids from the catalog; `check_webgl_smoke_output.py` validates nonblank RGB, exact ID colors, visible labels, primitive finger occlusion, and layer-order audit output; `check_webgl_label_views.py` validates packaged detect/OBB/fragment views and prevents diagnostic-only OBB labels from being mistaken for trainable data; `check_synthetic_recipe_catalog.py` validates target/recipe config coverage.
- Evaluation and deploy guards: `check_real_fan_benchmark.py`, `run_browser_smoke_cases.py`, `check_browser_stack_artifacts.py`, `build_webgl_recipe_ablation_configs.py`, `run_webgl_recipe_ablation.py`, `val_yolo.py`, `compare_yolo_metrics.py`, `export_yolo.py`.
- Real capture/review: `check_capture_requirements.py`, `run_capture_review_pipeline.py`, `summarize_camera_metadata.py`, `apply_review_export.py`, `summarize_review_manifests.py`, `render_yolo_label_preview.py`, `evaluate_real_draft_labels.py`.
- Fragment diagnostics: `build_fragment_classifier_from_review_pack.py`, `train_fragment_classifier.py`, `evaluate_fragment_classifier.py`, `classify_yolo_proposals.py`, `fuse_two_stage_csv.py`, `sweep_two_stage_fusion.py`, `inspect_two_stage_matches.py`, `probe_fragment_count_fusion.py`.

The scripts folder is still large because it records past probes. Before adding a new script, either reuse one of these or make the new entry clearly active in this section.

## P0 3D Renderer Smoke

Goal: prove renderer and labels, not model quality.

Config: `configs/3d_pipeline/proof_p0_renderer_smoke.json`

Scope:

- 20 scenes
- `KHR_5000` and `KHR_10000`
- front and back
- single, simple overlap, and shop stack
- basic bends/curls
- visual pass and ID pass
- detect labels, OBB labels, masks, overlays

Current scaffold:

- `scripts/render_3d_pipeline_probe.py` consumes the P0/P1 JSON config style.
- It renders perspective-warped Numista notes with simple contact shadows, visual images, flat ID masks, visible-only YOLO detect labels, OBB sidecar labels, OBB metadata, scene metadata, `data.yaml`, label stats, contact sheets, and mask overlays.
- P0 smoke output path: `data/synthetic/cashsnap_3d_p0_renderer_smoke/`.
- Last P0 smoke: 20 scenes in about 20-30 seconds; deterministic contact-sheet hash matched across reruns; `check_yolo_dataset.py --data data\synthetic\cashsnap_3d_p0_renderer_smoke\data.yaml` passed with 16 train images / 47 boxes and 4 val images / 13 boxes; `qa/label_stats.json` reports 66 instances and 60 exported labels.
- This scaffold is not the final 3D renderer. It proves the label/QA contract before WebGL/PBR/material realism.

Success:

- nonblank renders
- textures aligned
- ID colors map one-to-one to instances
- labels are visible-only, not amodal hidden-note extents
- same seed reruns deterministically
- contact shadows or depth cues are visible in overlap scenes

## P1 3D Transfer Proof

Goal: test whether 3D beats matched 2.5D on real scoreable partials.

Config: `configs/3d_pipeline/proof_p1_transfer.json`

Scope:

- 100-300 scenes
- targeted `KHR_5000` portrait-plus-number overlap
- confusing `KHR_10000` front/back views
- `KHR_20000` thin/edge cases
- several phone/browser camera profiles
- realistic postprocess

Compare against:

- matched 2.5D dataset
- current two-stage baseline
- scoreable real shop-overlap labels
- clean `cashsnap_v1` validation
- browser/export smoke

Only scale to thousands of scenes if P1 improves real partial metrics without materially regressing clean validation.

Current P1 render smoke:

- Command ran through `scripts/run_with_headroom.py` so it could preflight/pause for laptop safety.
- Output path: `data/synthetic/cashsnap_3d_p1_transfer_proof/`.
- 240 scenes rendered; `check_yolo_dataset.py --data data\synthetic\cashsnap_3d_p1_transfer_proof\data.yaml` passed with 192 train images / 682 boxes and 48 val images / 164 boxes.
- `qa/label_stats.json` reports 1,006 instances and 846 exported labels across `KHR_5000`, `KHR_10000`, and `KHR_20000`.
- The current Python/OpenCV renderer is useful for label-contract proof, but it is CPU-native and visually simple. Do not train from this scaffold as if it were final data.

## WebGL Renderer Smoke

Goal: keep the synthetic factory auditable: realistic-enough RGB, exact ID colors, visible-only labels, reproducible variants, and package QA that prevents diagnostic labels from becoming training data by accident.

Current contract:

- Renderer: `renderers/webgl/` uses Three.js and `puppeteer-core` against local Microsoft Edge by default; Edge is verified GPU-backed on this laptop through ANGLE/D3D11. Use `CASHSNAP_WEBGL_BROWSER` or `--browser-executable` only for deliberate Chromium A/B tests.
- Output: default RGB is 1440x1080 with RGB-only supersampling; ID pass is a separate non-antialiased render with black background and exact one-color-per-instance masks.
- Labels: detect boxes are visible-only compatibility labels; OBB export is allowed only for compact honest masks; visible-fragment labels are evidence/OCR inputs and must be fused back to physical parents before counting.
- Package QA: WebGL packages must include `recipe.json`, `qa/summary.json`, preview overlays, visual+ID overlays, `qa/quarantine.json`, and `qa/contact_index.json`; gates validate hashes, label views, trainability policy, ignored fragments, and OBB exclusions.
- Assets: WebGL uses the 13-class schema from `data/cashsnap_v1/data.yaml` and scan PNGs from `data/asset_candidates/numista_current_cutout_bank_v1/`; the current Numista audit has 76 assets, full front/back coverage for all 13 classes, and 3 red-mark suspects.
- Scene controls: variants are deterministic; class selection uses a co-prime stride; `asset-side-policy` controls front/back sampling; `camera-profile` records phone/browser framing assumptions before RGB/ID extraction.
- Occlusion and stacking: primitive finger capsules are the accepted hand-occlusion placeholder; note planes use explicit render order to keep visible masks label-safe. This is a controlled topology shortcut, not a physical contact solver.
- Backgrounds: no trainable real background bank is currently accepted. Existing extracted no-note banks were rejected for leaked note fragments, people/arms, outdoor/vertical contexts, or mask artifacts; `data/backgrounds/webgl_reviewed_clean_smoke_v1/` is only a two-image smoke proof.
- Performance: keep textures file-backed instead of base64-inlined. If render batches hit Chrome/RAM pressure, lower `visual_scale` or pass stricter headroom caps through the suite/pipeline wrappers.

Important caveats:

- Geometric lens distortion/crop is still parked until masks and boxes are transformed with it; current postprocess is non-geometric only.
- Smooth macro curl is acceptable; sinusoidal ripple looked corrugated and should stay off unless backed by a real crease/fold model.
- Tiny visible slivers below `--min-visible-pixels` stay in the ID image but are ignored as class labels.
- Dedicated split-label QA proved the counting trap: 3 physical bills can create 5 visible fragments, and full-schema fan smoke had 67 physical visible instances vs 120 fragments. Fragment outputs cannot be summed directly.

## Research Checkpoint

2026-05-30 bounded synthesis-data review:

- Synthetic data is useful because it can provide pixel-perfect labels, but domain gap remains the core risk; mixing synthetic with real data is repeatedly favored over treating synthetic as a full replacement. Source: [Eversberg and Lambrecht 2021](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/23/7901).
- There is no universal winner between photorealistic rendering and domain randomization. Domain knowledge about the target scene and object-specific realism can matter more than global prettiness. Source: [Eversberg and Lambrecht 2021](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/23/7901).
- Domain randomization studies point to object/texture diversity, camera positioning, and occlusion as meaningful parameters; random noise alone is lower leverage. Source: [Domain randomization review, PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8570318/).
- Hand-occlusion literature treats occlusion-aware augmentation as a valid first step, and papers cite black solid shapes or object segments pasted over people as established augmentation. This supports primitive finger occluders before a full hand mesh. Source: [HandOccNet CVPR 2022](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Park_HandOccNet_Occlusion-Robust_3D_Hand_Mesh_Estimation_Network_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf).
- Recent synthetic-generation surveys frame 3D generators around either photorealistic rendering or domain randomization, but both still need target-domain validation. Source: [Artificial Intelligence Review 2025 synthetic generation survey](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-025-11431-3).

Decision from this pass: do not chase full PBR or a full hand mesh yet. Build a small WebGL batch proof with controlled banknote layer geometry, real-ish table/background variation, primitive fingers, exact visible masks, and measured comparison against the Python/2.5D baselines plus real partial/fan gates.

2026-05-30 camera/lens decision:

- Three.js still holds for the active renderer proof because it can render fast RGB scenes and exact ID passes locally, and its render-target/readback APIs are enough for future mask extraction. Source: [Three.js render targets](https://threejs.org/manual/en/rendertargets.html), [WebGLRenderer readback](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/WebGLRenderer.html).
- The renderer needs explicit phone-camera profiles, not generic perspective defaults. Seed profiles from common phone FOV/focal-length specs, but prefer EXIF from CashSnap capture images and calibration shots when available.
- Use an OpenCV-style pinhole camera plus radial/tangential distortion model for postprocess: camera matrix plus distortion coefficients `k1`, `k2`, `p1`, `p2`, `k3`. Source: [OpenCV camera calibration](https://docs.opencv.org/master/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html).
- Postprocess should be profile-driven: radial distortion, perspective/crop/resize, motion or focus blur, sensor noise/grain, JPEG/WebP compression, white balance, exposure/flash glare, and mild sharpening. Do not randomize these blindly; sample ranges from real captures once enough EXIF/images exist.
- Current public real benchmark candidates are weak camera-profile sources: two have no EXIF and `real_overlap_0002_commons_museum.jpg` only reports Canon EOS 600D make/model. Future phone capture/review pipelines should preserve EXIF so renderer camera profiles come from CashSnap target devices.
- `scripts/run_capture_review_pipeline.py` writes `camera_metadata.jsonl` beside review outputs; use that file to build phone/lens/postprocess priors before tuning WebGL camera profiles.

## Known Results

- Clean isolated-note detection is strong, but dense overlap/fan counting is not solved.
- Current alpha detector exports ONNX/NCNN and is useful diagnostically, but denomination totals remain unreliable on old-design overlap photos.
- Real fan failure is data/geometry, not NMS, tiling, or resolution. NMS sweeps and higher inference sizes did not solve it.
- OBB thin-slice probes can produce plausible small rotated boxes, but class labels are noisy; OBB is not chosen until a real labeled fan/overlap benchmark exists.
- The hard VOA fan image is a stress probe, not a fair scoreboard, because many visible slices are backs or ambiguous fragments.
- Current best PyTorch-side shop-overlap diagnostic is old/common KHR detector/classifier fusion around detector threshold 0.17, reaching 5/6 same-class on draft labels.
- Browser stack is deployable-size but not quality-solved. It protects USD/KHR guard cases but still miscounts the shop-overlap draft.
- OCR is not a shortcut. Khmer OCR cues were noisy and wrong on shop-overlap crops.
- Template matching is not a shortcut. SIFT/ORB/AKAZE performed poorly on the compact P1 failure queue.
- Broad dataset searches in May 2026 found useful public KHR/USD partial/fan references, but no rights-clean scoreable P1 benchmark substitute. Stop broad hunting unless a specific new lead appears.
- Roboflow `cuurecy-detection-is` is useful but not clean proof: it has real partial/overlap examples, front/back masks, and repeated layouts/split caveats.
- PicWish can generate lots of cutouts, but skin/hand contamination repeatedly caused regressions.
- Numista clean scan fragments alone did not fix `KHR_5000 -> KHR_10000` partial confusion.
- Light-dose Numista 2.5D calibration was the best 2.5D direction so far: cleaner than broad synthetic, but still overcounts and confuses backs.
- The remaining high-confidence shop-overlap miss is a real partial-evidence problem, not just confidence calibration.

## Untested Or Parked Ideas

- Detector plus fragment classifier remains viable if fed reviewed real partial crops.
- Segmentation/OBB labels should be preserved from generated masks even when training detect-only.
- More rights-clear phone captures of `KHR_5000` face+number overlaps and `KHR_20000` thin/edge backs are high leverage.
- A tiny `banknote_unknown`/ignore policy for fragments without enough denomination evidence is better than forcing labels.

## Data Cleanup Policy

Keep:

- canonical raw/cutout assets
- clean validation data
- real benchmark evaluation data
- reviewed real captures/review packs
- tiny configs/manifests/QA summaries that reproduce a result

Delete or regenerate:

- one-off synthetic datasets with no promoted result
- stale fragment-classifier generated folders
- stale diagnostics under `tmp/`, `data/diagnostics/`, `data/sampled/`, `data/processed/`, `data/dedup/`, `data/deprecated/`
- old browser screenshots/logs unless attached to an active bug

Before deleting a large data directory, verify it is under `D:\Project\KhmerCurrencyOCR` and not Tier 0/Tier 1.

## Documentation Policy

This file is the living plan. Root `AGENTS.md` should stay short and point here. `docs/` is archive/reference only; do not add another active plan there. If something matters for model work, put it here.

Keep this file honest during normal work. When a phase is achieved, abandoned, or superseded, rename or remove the old section instead of leaving stale labels like active tasks. Collapse completed checklists into current facts, delete parked ideas that became real features, and keep only the details that help the next agent make a better model decision.

Preferred documentation shape: one project `AGENTS.md`, this working `model.md`, and one user-facing `README.md`. Folder-level READMEs or extra docs should be temporary, archived reference, or deleted once their useful content is folded into the main three files.

Script organization should stay active too. When `scripts/` or other tool folders become noisy, group tools by current state such as `active/`, `archive/`, or domain folders only after checking imports, CLI references, and workflows that would break from a move.

Current script shape: root `scripts/` holds active helpers and wired workflows; `scripts/archive/` holds standalone historical probes/prep tools that are not referenced by the active docs/configs/code path. Restore an archived script to root only when it becomes part of the live workflow again.
